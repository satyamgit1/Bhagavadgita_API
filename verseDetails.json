        "Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the widely read theistic science summarized in the G\u012bt\u0101-m\u0101h\u0101tmya (Glorification of the G\u012bt\u0101). There it says that one should read Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 very scrutinizingly with the help of a person who is a devotee of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and try to understand it without personally motivated interpretations. The example of clear understanding is there in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 itself, in the way the teaching is understood by Arjuna, who heard the G\u012bt\u0101 directly from the Lord. If someone is fortunate enough to understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in that line of disciplic succession, without motivated interpretation, then he surpasses all studies of Vedic wisdom, and all scriptures of the world. One will find in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 all that is contained in other scriptures, but the reader will also find things which are not to be found elsewhere. That is the specific standard of the G\u012bt\u0101. It is the perfect theistic science because it is directly spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u00a0",
        "The topics discussed by Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and Sa\u00f1jaya, as described in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, form the basic principle for this great philosophy. It is understood that this philosophy evolved on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, which is a sacred place of pilgrimage from the immemorial time of the Vedic age. It was spoken by the Lord when He was present personally on this planet for the guidance of mankind.\u00a0",
        "The word dharma-k\u1e63etra (a place where religious rituals are performed) is significant because, on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present on the side of Arjuna. Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, the father of the Kurus, was highly doubtful about the possibility of his sons\u2019 ultimate victory. In his doubt, he inquired from his secretary Sa\u00f1jaya, \u201cWhat did my sons and the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du do?\u201d He was confident that both his sons and the sons of his younger brother P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du were assembled in that Field of Kuruk\u1e63etra for a determined engagement of the war. Still, his inquiry is significant. He did not want a compromise between the cousins and brothers, and he wanted to be sure of the fate of his sons on the battlefield. Because the battle was arranged to be fought at Kuruk\u1e63etra, which is mentioned elsewhere in the Vedas as a place of worship— even for the denizens of heaven— Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra became very fearful about the influence of the holy place on the outcome of the battle. He knew very well that this would influence Arjuna and the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du favorably, because by nature they were all virtuous. Sa\u00f1jaya was a student of Vy\u0101sa, and therefore, by the mercy of Vy\u0101sa, Sa\u00f1jaya was able to envision the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra even while he was in the room of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. And so, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra asked him about the situation on the battlefield.\u00a0",
        "Both the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra belong to the same family, but Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra\u2019s mind is disclosed herein. He deliberately claimed only his sons as Kurus, and he separated the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du from the family heritage. One can thus understand the specific position of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra in his relationship with his nephews, the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du. As in the paddy field the unnecessary plants are taken out, so it is expected from the very beginning of these topics that in the religious field of Kuruk\u1e63etra where the father of religion, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, was present, the unwanted plants like Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra\u2019s son Duryodhana and others would be wiped out and the thoroughly religious persons, headed by Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, would be established by the Lord. This is the significance of the words dharma-k\u1e63etre and kuru-k\u1e63etre, apart from their historical and Vedic importance.\u00a0"

Sa\u00f1jaya therefore informed the King that his son, Duryodhana, after seeing the military force of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, at once went to the commander-in-chief, Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya, to inform him of the real position.

Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya knew this perfectly well, and yet, as a liberal br\u0101hma\u1e47a, he did not hesitate to impart all his military secrets when the son of Drupada, Dh\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dadyumna, was entrusted to him for military education.

        "Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is referred to as H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba in this verse because He is the owner of all senses. The living entities are part and parcel of Him, and, therefore, the senses of the living entities are also part and parcel of His senses. The impersonalists cannot account for the senses of the living entities, and therefore they are always anxious to describe all living entities as sense-less, or impersonal. The Lord, situated in the hearts of all living entities, directs their senses. But, He directs in terms of the surrender of the living entity, and in the case of a pure devotee He directly controls the senses. Here on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra the Lord directly controls the transcendental senses of Arjuna, and thus His particular name of H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba. The Lord has different names according to His different activities. For example, His name is Madhus\u016bdana because He killed the demon of the name Madhu; His name is Govinda because He gives pleasure to the cows and to the senses; His name is V\u0101sudeva because He appeared as the son of Vasudeva; His name is Devak\u012b-nandana because He accepted Devak\u012b as His mother; His name is Ya\u015bod\u0101-nandana because He awarded His childhood pastimes to Ya\u015bod\u0101 at V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana; His name is P\u0101rtha-s\u0101rathi because He worked as charioteer of His friend Arjuna. Similarly, His name is H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba because He gave direction to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra.\u00a0",
        "Arjuna is referred to as Dhana\u00f1jaya in this verse because he helped his elder brother in fetching wealth when it was required by the King to make expenditures for different sacrifices. Similarly, Bh\u012bma is known as V\u1e5bkodara because he could eat as voraciously as he could perform Herculean tasks, such as killing the demon Hi\u1e0dimba. So, the particular types of conchshell blown by the different personalities on the side of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, beginning with the Lord\u2019s, were all very encouraging to the fighting soldiers. On the other side there were no such credits, nor the presence of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme director, nor that of the goddess of fortune. So, they were predestined to lose the battle-and that was the message announced by the sounds of the conchshells.\u00a0"

Now both R\u0101ma and Hanum\u0101n were present on the chariot of Arjuna to help him. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is R\u0101ma Himself, and wherever Lord R\u0101ma is, His eternal servitor Hanum\u0101n and His eternal consort S\u012bt\u0101, the goddess of fortune, are present. Therefore, Arjuna had no cause to fear any enemies whatsoever. And above all, the Lord of the senses, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, was personally present to give him direction. Thus, all good counsel was available to Arjuna in the matter of executing the battle. In such auspicious conditions, arranged by the Lord for His eternal devotee, lay the signs of assured victory.\u00a0"

        "Although Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, out of His causeless mercy He was engaged in the service of His friend. He never fails in His affection for His devotees, and thus He is addressed herein as infallible. As charioteer, He had to carry out the orders of Arjuna, and since He did not hesitate to do so, He is addressed as infallible. Although He had accepted the position of a charioteer for His devotee, His supreme position was not challenged. In all circumstances, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hṛṣīkeśa, the Lord of the total senses. The relationship between the Lord and His servitor is very sweet and transcendental. The servitor is always ready to render a service to the Lord, and, similarly, the Lord is always seeking an opportunity to render some service to the devotee. He takes greater pleasure in His pure devotee’s assuming the advantageous postion of ordering Him than He does in being the giver of orders. As master, everyone is under His orders, and no one is above Him to order Him. But when he finds that a pure devotee is ordering Him, He obtains transcendental pleasure, although He is the infallible master of all circumstances.",
        "As a pure devotee of the Lord, Arjuna had no desire to fight with his cousins and brothers, but he was forced to come onto the battlefield by the obstinacy of Duryodhana, who was never agreeable to any peaceful negotiation. Therefore, he was very anxious to see who the leading persons present on the battlefield were. Although there was no question of a peacemaking endeavor on the battlefield, he wanted to see them again, and to see how much they were bent upon demanding an unwanted war. "

As such, Arjuna, just after seeing his kinsmen, friends and relatives on the battlefield, was at once overwhelmed by compassion for them who had so decided to fight amongst themselves. As far as his soldiers were concerned, he was sympathetic from the beginning, but he felt compassion even for the soldiers of the opposite party, foreseeing their imminent death. And so thinking, the limbs of his body began to quiver, and his mouth became dry. He was more or less astonished to see their fighting spirit. Practically the whole community, all blood relatives of Arjuna, had come to fight with him. This overwhelmed a kind devotee like Arjuna. Although it is not mentioned here, still one can easily imagine that not only were Arjuna\u2019s bodily limbs quivering and his mouth drying up, but that he was also crying out of compassion. Such symptoms in Arjuna were not due to weakness but to his softheartedness, a characteristic of a pure devotee of the Lord. It is said therefore:\u00a0",

On the other hand, a person devoid of devotional service and engaged in material activities has no good qualities. Even if he is adept at the practice of mystic yoga or the honest endeavor of maintaining his family and relatives, he must be driven by his own mental speculations and must engage in the service of the Lord's external energy.

        "Arjuna has addressed Lord Kṛṣṇa as Govinda because Kṛṣṇa is the object of all pleasures for cows and the senses. By using this significant word, Arjuna indicates what will satisfy his senses. Although Govinda is not meant for satisfying our senses, if we try to satisfy the senses of Govinda then automatically our own senses are satisfied. Materially, everyone wants to satisfy his senses, and he wants God to be the order supplier for such satisfaction. The Lord will satisfy the senses of the living entities as much as they deserve, but not to the extent that they may covet. But when one takes the opposite way-namely, when one tries to satisfy the senses of Govinda without desiring to satisfy one’s own senses-then by the grace of Govinda all desires of the living entity are satisfied. Arjuna’s deep affection for community and family members is exhibited here partly due to his natural compassion for them. He is therefore not prepared to fight. Everyone wants to show his opulence to friends and relatives, but Arjuna fears that all his relatives and friends will be killed in the battlefield, and he will be unable to share his opulence after victory. This is a typical calculation of material life. The transcendental life is, however, different. Since a devotee wants to satisfy the desires of the Lord, he can, Lord willing, accept all kinds of opulence for the service of the Lord, and if the Lord is not willing, he should not accept a farthing. Arjuna did not want to kill his relatives, and if there were any need to kill them, he desired that Kṛṣṇa kill them personally. At this point he did not know that Kṛṣṇa had already killed them before their coming into the battlefield and that he was only to become an instrument for Kṛṣṇa. This fact is disclosed in following chapters. As a natural devotee of the Lord, Arjuna did not like to retaliate against his miscreant cousins and brothers, but it was the Lord’s plan that they should all be killed. The devotee of the Lord does not retaliate against the wrongdoer, but the Lord does not tolerate any mischief done to the devotee by the miscreants. The Lord can excuse a person on His own account, but He excuses no one who has done harm to His devotees. Therefore the Lord was determined to kill the miscreants, although Arjuna wanted to excuse them."

        "According to Vedic injunctions there are six kinds of aggressors: 1) a poison giver, 2) one who sets fire to the house, 3) one who attacks with deadly weapons, 4) one who plunders riches, 5) one who occupies another\u2019s land, and 6) one who kidnaps a wife. Such aggressors are at once to be killed, and no sin is incurred by killing such aggressors. Such killing of aggressors is quite befitting for any ordinary man, but Arjuna was not an ordinary person. He was saintly by character, and therefore he wanted to deal with them in saintliness. This kind of saintliness, however, is not for a k\u1e63atriya. Although a responsible man in the administration of a state is required to be saintly, he should not be cowardly. For example, Lord R\u0101ma was so saintly that people were anxious to live in His kingdom, (R\u0101ma-r\u0101jya), but Lord R\u0101ma never showed any cowardice. R\u0101va\u1e47a was an aggressor against R\u0101ma because he kidnapped R\u0101ma\u2019s wife, S\u012bt\u0101, but Lord R\u0101ma gave him sufficient lessons, unparalleled in the history of the world. In Arjuna\u2019s case, however, one should consider the special type of aggressors, namely his own grandfather, own teacher, friends, sons, grandsons, etc. Because of them, Arjuna thought that he should not take the severe steps necessary against ordinary aggressors. Besides that, saintly persons are advised to forgive. Such injunctions for saintly persons are more important than any political emergency. Arjuna considered that rather than kill his own kinsmen for political reasons, it would be better to forgive them on grounds of religion and saintly behavior. He did not, therefore, consider such killing profitable simply for the matter of temporary bodily happiness. After all, kingdoms and pleasures derived therefrom are not permanent, so why should he risk his life and eternal salvation by killing his own kinsmen? Arjuna\u2019s addressing of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as \u201cM\u0101dhava,\u201d or the husband of the goddess of fortune, is also significant in this connection. He wanted to point out to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that, as husband of the goddess of fortune, He should not have to induce Arjuna to take up a matter which would ultimately bring about misfortune. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, never brings misfortune to anyone, to say nothing of His devotees.\u00a0"

Obligation is actually binding when the effect is good, but when the effect is otherwise, then no one can be bound. Considering all these pros and cons, Arjuna decided not to fight. "

Such population depends on the chastity and faithfulness of its womanhood. As children are very prone to be misled, women are similarly very prone to degradation.

Bhagav\u0101n is the ultimate in the Absolute Truth. Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding, namely Brahman or the impersonal all-pervasive spirit; Param\u0101tm\u0101, or the localized aspect of the Supreme within the heart of all living entities; and Bhagav\u0101n, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

          "\u201cThe Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding by the knower of the Absolute Truth, and all of them are identical. Such phases of the Absolute Truth are expressed as Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101, and Bhagav\u0101n.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.11) Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual substance Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 or Bhagav\u0101n. These three divine aspects can be explained by the example of the sun, which also has three different aspects, namely the sunshine, the sun\u2019s surface and the sun planet itself. One who studies the sunshine only is the preliminary student. One who understands the sun\u2019s surface is further advanced. And one who can enter into the sun planet is the highest. Ordinary students who are satisfied by simply understanding the sunshine-its universal pervasiveness and the glaring effulgence of its impersonal nature-may be compared to those who can realize only the Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth. The student who has advanced still further can know the sun disc, which is compared to knowledge of the Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature of the Absolute Truth. And the student who can enter into the heart of the sun planet is compared to those who realize the personal features of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Therefore, the bhaktas, or the transcendentalists who have realized the Bhagav\u0101n feature of the Absolute Truth, are the topmost transcendentalists, although all students who are engaged in the study of the Absolute Truth are engaged in the same subject matter. The sunshine, the sun disc and the inner affairs of the sun planet cannot be separated from one another, and yet the students of the three different phases are not in the same category.\u00a0",
          "The Sanskrit word Bhagav\u0101n is explained by the great authority, Par\u0101\u015bara Muni, the father of Vy\u0101sadeva. The Supreme Personality who possesses all riches, all strength, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all renunciation is called Bhagav\u0101n. There are many persons who are very rich, very powerful, very beautiful, very famous, very learned, and very much detached, but no one can claim that he possesses all riches, all strength, etc., entirely. Only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can claim this because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No living entity, including Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva, or N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, can possess opulences as fully as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore it is concluded in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 by Lord Brahm\u0101 himself that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No one is equal to or above Him. He is the primeval Lord, or Bhagav\u0101n, known as Govinda, and He is the supreme cause of all causes.\u00a0",
          "īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ \n anādir ādir govindaḥ sarua-kāraṇa-kāraṇam",
          "\u201cThere are many personalities possessing the qualities of Bhagav\u0101n, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme because none can excel Him. He is the Supreme Person, and His body is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. He is the primeval Lord Govinda and the cause of all causes.\u201d (Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 5.1)\u00a0",
          "In the Bhāgavatam also there is a list of many incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but Kṛṣṇa is described as the original Personality of Godhead, from whom many, many incarnations and Personalities of Godhead expand:",
          "ete cāṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam \n indrāri-vyākulaṁ lokaṁ mṛḍayanti yuge yuge",
          "“All the lists of the incarnations of Godhead submitted herewith are either plenary expansions or parts of the plenary expansions of the Supreme Godhead, but Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.” (Bhag. 1.3.28) ",
          "Therefore, Kṛṣṇa is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, the source of both the Supersoul and the impersonal Brahman.",
          "In the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna’s lamentation for his kinsmen is certainly unbecoming, and therefore Kṛṣṇa expressed His surprise with the word kutas, “wherefrom.” Such unmanly sentiments were never expected from a person belonging to the civilized class of men known as Āryans. The word āryan is applicable to persons who know the value of life and have a civilization based on spiritual realization. Persons who are led by the material conception of life do not know that the aim of life is realization of the Absolute Truth, Viṣṇu, or Bhagavān, and they are captivated by the external features of the material world, and therefore they do not know what liberation is. Persons who have no knowledge of liberation from material bondage are called non-Āryans. Although Arjuna was a kṣatriya, he was deviating from his prescribed duties by declining to fight. This act of cowardice is described as befitting the non-Āryans. Such deviation from duty does not help one in the progress of spiritual life, nor does it even give one the opportunity to become famous in this world. Lord Kṛṣṇa did not approve of the so-called compassion of Arjuna for his kinsmen."

Therefore Arjuna had a blood relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

Arjuna was the most intimate friend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was directly guiding him on the chariot; but in spite of all these credits, if Arjuna abandoned the battle, he would be committing an infamous act; therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said that such an attitude in Arjuna did not fit his personality. Arjuna might argue that he would give up the battle on the grounds of his magnanimous attitude for the most respectable Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and his relatives, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a considered that sort of magnanimity not approved by authority.

          "By nature\u2019s own way the complete system of material activities is a source of perplexity for everyone. In every step there is perplexity, and therefore it behooves one to approach a bona fide spiritual master who can give one proper guidance for executing the purpose of life. All Vedic literatures advise us to approach a bona fide spiritual master to get free from the perplexities of life which happen without our desire. They are like a forest fire that somehow blazes without being set by anyone. Similarly, the world situation is such that perplexities of life automatically appear, without our wanting such confusion. No one wants fire, and yet it takes place, and we become perplexed. The Vedic wisdom therefore advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to understand the science of the solution, one must approach a spiritual master who is in the disciplic succession. A person with a bona fide spiritual master is supposed to know everything. One should not, therefore, remain in material perplexities but should approach a spiritual master. This is the purport of this verse.\u00a0",

          "\u201cHe is a miserly man who does not solve the problems of life as a human and who thus quits this world like the cats and dogs, without understanding the science of self-realization.\u201d This human form of life is a most valuable asset for the living entity who can ultilize it for solving the problems of life; therefore, one who does not utilize this opportunity properly is a miser. On the other hand, there is the br\u0101hma\u1e47a, or he who is intelligent enough to utilize this body to solve all the problems of life.\u00a0",
          "The k\u1e5bpa\u1e47as, or miserly persons, waste their time in being overly affectionate for family, society, country, etc., in the material conception of life. One is often attached to family life, namely to wife, children and other members, on the basis of \u201cskin disease.\u201d The k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a thinks that he is able to protect his family members from death; or the k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a thinks that his family or society can save him from the verge of death. Such family attachment can be found even in the lower animals who take care of children also. Being intelligent, Arjuna could understand that his affection for family members and his wish to protect them from death were the causes ot his perplexities. Although he could understand that his duty to fight was awaiting him, still, on account of miserly weakness, he could not discharge the duties. He is therefore asking Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme spiritual master, to make a definite solution. He offers himself to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a disciple. He wants to stop friendly talks. Talks between the master and the disciple are serious, and now Arjuna wants to talk very seriously before the recognized spiritual master. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is therefore the original spiritual master of the science of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and Arjuna is the first disciple for understanding the G\u012bt\u0101. How Arjuna understands the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is stated in the G\u012bt\u0101 itself.

          "Although Arjuna was putting forward so many arguments based on knowledge of the principles of religion and moral codes, it appears that he was unable to solve his real problem without the help of the spiritual master, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He could understand that his so-called knowledge was useless in driving away his problems, which were drying up his whole existence; and it was impossible for him to solve such perplexities without the help of a spiritual master like Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Academic knowledge, scholarship, high position, etc., are all useless in solving the problems of life; help can only be given by a spiritual master like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, the conclusion is that a spiritual master who is one hundred percent K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is the bona fide spiritual master, for he can solve the problems of life. Lord Caitanya said that one who is master in the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, regardless of his social position, is the real spiritual master.\u00a0",
          "kibāvipra, kibā nyāsī, śūdra kene naya \n yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā, sei ‘guru’ haya. \n (Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Madhya 8.127)",

But a person born in a family of a lower caste can become a spiritual master if he is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.\u201d\u00a0",
          "The problems of material existence— birth, old age, disease and death— cannot be counteracted by accumulation of wealth and economic development. In many parts of the world there are states which are replete with all facilities of life, which are full of wealth, and economically developed, yet the problems of material existence are still present. They are seeking peace in different ways, but they ean achieve real happiness only if they consult K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam— which constitute the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a— or the bona fide representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the man in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u00a0",
          "If economic development and material comforts could drive away one’s lamentations for family, social, national or international inebrieties, then Arjuna would not have said that even an unrivalled kingdom on earth or supremacy like that of the demigods in the heavenly planets would not be able to drive away his lamentations. He sought, therefore, refuge in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and that is the right path for peace and harmony. Economic development or supremacy over the world can be finished at any moment by the cataclysms of material nature. Even elevation into a higher planetary situation, as men are now seeking a place on the moon planet, can also be finished at one stroke. The Bhagavad-gītā confirms this: kṣīṇe puṇye martyalokaṁ viśanti “When the results of pious activities are finished, one falls down again from the peak of happiness to the lowest status of life.” Many politicians of the world have fallen down in that way. Such downfalls only constitute more causes for lamentation.",
          "Therefore, if we want to curb lamentation for good, then we have to take shelter of Kṛṣṇa, as Arjuna is seeking to do. So Arjuna asked Kṛṣṇa to solve his problem definitely, and that is the way of Kṛṣṇa consciousness."

Even accepting the argument that the individuality is material, then how can one distinguish K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s individuality? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a affirms His individuality in the past and confirms His individuality in the future also. He has confirmed His individuality in many ways, and impersonal Brahman has been declared to be subordinate to Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has maintained spiritual individuality all along; if He is accepted as an ordinary conditioned soul in individual consciousness, then His Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 has no value as authoritative scripture. A common man with all the four defects of human frailty is unable to teach that which is worth hearing. The G\u012bt\u0101 is above such literature. No mundane book compares with the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. When one accepts K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as an ordinary man, the G\u012bt\u0101 loses all importance. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b argues that the plurality mentioned in this verse is conventional and that it refers to the body. But previous to this verse such a bodily conception is already condemned. After condemning the bodily conception of the living entities, how was it possible for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to place a conventional proposition on the body again? Therefore, individuality is maintained on spiritual grounds and is thus confirmed by great \u0101c\u0101ryas like \u015ar\u012b R\u0101m\u0101nuja and others. It is clearly mentioned in many places in the G\u012bt\u0101 that this spiritual individuality is understood by those who are devotees of the Lord. Those who are envious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no bona fide access to the great literature. The nondevotee\u2019s approach to the teachings of the G\u012bta is something like bees licking on a bottle of honey. One cannot have a taste of honey unless one opens the bottle. Similarly, the mysticism of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 can be understood only by devotees, and no one else can taste it, as it is stated in the Fourth Chapter of the book. Nor can the G\u012bt\u0101 be touched by persons who envy the very existence of the Lord. Therefore, the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b explanation of the G\u012bt\u0101 is a most misleading presentation of the whole truth. Lord Caitanya has forbidden us to read commentations made by the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs and warns that one who takes to such an understanding of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophy loses all power to understand the real mystery of the G\u012bt\u0101. If individuality refers to the empirical universe, then there is no need of teaching by the Lord. The plurality of the individual soul and of the Lord is an eternal fact, and it is confirmed by the Vedas as above mentioned.\u00a0"

          "Since every living entity is an individual soul, each is changing his body every moment, manifesting sometimes as a child, sometimes as a youth, and sometimes as an old man. Yet the same spirit soul is there and does not undergo any change. This individual soul finally changes the body at death and transmigrates to another body; and since it is sure to have another body in the next birth— either material or spiritual— there was no cause for lamentation by Arjuna on account of death, neither for Bh\u012b\u1e63ma nor for Dro\u1e47a, for whom he was so much concerned. Rather, he should rejoice for their changing bodies from old to new ones, thereby rejuvenating their energy. Such changes of body account for varieties of enjoyment or suffering, according to one\u2019s work in life. So Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and Dro\u1e47a, being noble souls, were surely going to have either spiritual bodies in the next life, or at least life in heavenly bodies for superior enjoyment of material existence. So, in either case, there was no cause of lamentation.\u00a0",
          "Any man who has perfect knowledge of the constitution of the individual soul, the Supersoul, and nature— both material and spiritual— is called a dh\u012bra or a most sober man. Such a man is never deluded by the change of bodies. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b theory of oneness of the spirit soul cannot be entertained on the ground that spirit soul cannot be cut into pieces as a fragmental portion. Such cutting into different individual souls would make the Supreme cleavable or changeable, against the principle of the Supreme Soul being unchangeable.\u00a0",
          "As confirmed in the G\u012bt\u0101, the fragmental portions of the Supreme exist eternally (san\u0101tana) and are called k\u1e63ara; that is, they have a tendency to fall down into material nature. These fragmental portions are eternally so, and even after liberation, the individual soul remains the same— fragmental. But once liberated, he lives an eternal life in bliss and knowledge with the Personality of Godhead. The theory of reflection can be applied to the Supersoul who is present in each and every individual body and is known as the Param\u0101tm\u0101, who is different from the individual living entity. When the sky is reflected in water, the reflections represent both the sun and the moon and the stars also. The stars can be compared to the living entities and the sun or the moon to the Supreme Lord. The individual fragmental spirit soul is represented by Arjuna, and the Supreme Soul is the Personality of Godhead \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They are not on the same level, as it will be apparent in the beginning of the Fourth Chapter. If Arjuna is on the same level with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not superior to Arjuna, then their relationship of instructor and instructed becomes meaningless. If both of them are deluded by the illusory energy (m\u0101y\u0101), then there is no need of one being the instructor and the other the instructed. Such instruction would be useless because, in the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101, no one can be an authoritative instructor. Under the circumstances, it is admitted that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Lord, superior in position to the living entity, Arjuna, who is a forgotten soul deluded by m\u0101y\u0101.\u00a0"

          "keśāgra-śata-bhāgasya śatāṁśaḥ sādṛśātmakaḥ \n jīvaḥ sūkṣma-svarupo ‘yaṁ saṅkhyātīto hi cit-kaṇaḥ",
          "\u201cThere are innumerable particles of spiritual atoms, which are measured as one ten-thousandth of the upper portion of the hair.\u201d\u00a0",
          "Therefore, the individual particle of spirit soul is a spiritual atom smaller than the material atoms, and such atoms are innumerable. This very small spiritual spark is the basic principle of the material body, and the influence of such a spiritual spark is spread all over the body as the influence of the active principle of some medicine spreads throughout the body. This current of the spirit soul is felt all over the body as consciousness, and that is the proof of the presence of the soul. Any layman can understand that the material body minus consciousness is a dead body, and this consciousness cannot be revived in the body by any means of material administration. Therefore, consciousness is not due to any amount of material combination, but to the spirit soul. In the Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad the measurement of the atomic spirit soul is further explained:\u00a0",
          "eṣo ‘ṇurātmā cetasā veditavyo \n yasmin prāṇaḥ pañcadhā saṁviveśa \n prāṇaiś cittaṁ sarvam otam prajānāṁ \n yasmin viśuddhe vibhavaty eṣa ātmā.",
          "“The soul is atomic in size and can be perceived by perfect intelligence. This atomic soul is floating in the five kinds of air [prāṇa, apāna, vyāna, samāna and udāna], is situated within the heart, and spreads its influence all over the body of the embodied living entities. When the soul is purified from the contamination of the five kinds of material air, its spiritual influence is exhibited.” (Muṇḍ. 3.1.9)",
          "The haṭha-yoga system is meant for controlling the five kinds of air encircling the pure soul by different kinds of sitting postures-not for any material profit, but for liberation of the minute soul from the entanglement of the material atmosphere.",
          "So the constitution of the atomic soul is admitted in all Vedic literatures, and it is also actually felt in the practical experience of any sane man. Only the insane man can think of this atomic soul as all-pervading Viṣṇu-tattva. ",
          "The influence of the atomic soul can be spread all over a particular body. According to the Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad, this atomic soul is situated in the heart of every living entity, and because the measurement of the atomic soul is beyond the power of appreciation of the material scientists, some of them assert foolishly that there is no soul. The individual atomic soul is definitely there in the heart along with the Supersoul, and thus all the energies of bodily movement are emanating from this part of the body. The corpuscles which carry the oxygen from the lungs gather energy from the soul. When the soul passes away from this position, activity of the blood, generating fusion, ceases. Medical science accepts the importance of the red corpuscles, but it cannot ascertain that the source of the energy is the soul. Medical science, however, does admit that the heart is the seat of all energies of the body.",
          "Such atomic particles of the spirit whole are compared to the sunshine molecules. In the sunshine there are innumerable radiant molecules. Similarly, the fragmental parts of the Supreme Lord are atomic sparks of the rays of the Supreme Lord, called by the name prabhā or superior energy. Neither Vedic knowledge nor modern science denies the existence of the spirit soul in the body, and the science of the soul is explicitly described in the Bhagavad-gītā by the Personality of Godhead Himself."

As mentioned in the previous verse, it is so small that no one can have any idea how to measure its dimension. So from both viewpoints there is no cause of lamentation because the living entity can neither be killed as he is, nor can the material body, which cannot be saved for any length of time, be permanently protected. The minute particle of the whole spirit acquires this material body according to his work, and therefore observance of religious principles should be utilized. In the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras the living entity is qualified as light because he is part and parcel of the supreme light. As sunlight maintains the entire universe, so the light of the soul maintains this material body. As soon as the spirit soul is out of this material body, the body begins to decompose; therefore it is the spirit soul which maintains this body. The body itself is unimportant. Arjuna was advised to fight and sacrifice the material body for the cause of religion.\u00a0"

          "Qualitatively, the small atomic fragmental part of the Supreme Spirit is one with the Supreme. He undergoes no changes like the body. Sometimes the soul is called the steady, or k\u016b\u1e6dastha. The body is subject to six kinds of transformations. It takes its birth in the womb of the mother\u2019s body, remains for some time, grows, produces some effects, gradually dwindles, and at last vanishes into oblivion. The soul, however, does not go through such changes. The soul is not born, but, because he takes on a material body, the body takes its birth. The soul does not take birth there, and the soul does not die. Anything which has birth also has death. And because the soul has no birth, he therefore has no past, present or future. He is eternal, ever-existing, and primeval-that is, there is no trace in history of his coming into being. Under the impression of the body, we seek the history of birth, etc., of the soul. The soul does not at any time become old, as the body does. The so-called old man, therefore, feels himself to be in the same spirit as in his childhood or youth. The changes of the body do not affect the soul. The soul does not deteriorate like a tree, nor anything material. The soul has no by-product either. The by-products of the body, namely children, are also different individual souls; and, owing to the body, they appear as children of a particular man. The body develops because of the soul\u2019s presence, but the soul has neither offshoots nor change. Therefore, the soul is free from the six changes of the body.\u00a0",
          "In the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad also we find a similar passage which reads:\u00a0",

          "The soul is full of knowledge, or full always with consciousness. Therefore, consciousness is the symptom of the soul. Even if one does not find the soul within the heart, where he is situated, one can still understand the presence of the soul simply by the presence of consciousness. Sometimes we do not find the sun in the sky owing to clouds, or for some other reason, but the light of the sun is always there, and we are convinced that it is therefore daytime. As soon as there is a little light in the sky early in the morning, we can understand that the sun is in the sky. Similarly, since there is some consciousness in all bodies— whether man or animal— we can understand the presence of the soul. This consciousness of the soul is, however, different from the consciousness of the Supreme because the supreme consciousness is all-knowledge— past, present and future. The consciousness of the individual soul is prone to be forgetful. When he is forgetful of his real nature, he obtains education and enlightenment from the superior lessons of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not like the forgetful soul. If so, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s teachings of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 would be useless.\u00a0",
          "There are two kinds of souls-namely the minute particle soul (aṇu-ātmā) and the Supersoul (the vibhu-ātmā). This is also confirmed in the Kaṭha Upaniṣad in this way:",
          "aṇor aṇīyān mahato mahīyān \n ātmāsya jantor nihito guhāyām \n tam akratuḥ paśyati vīta-śoko \n dhātuḥ prasādān mahimānam ātmanaḥ \n (Kaṭha 1.2.20)",
          "“Both the Supersoul [Paramātmā] and the atomic soul [jīvātmā] are situated on the same tree of the body within the same heart of the living being, and only one who has become free from all material desires as well as lamentations can, by the grace of the Supreme, understand the glories of the soul.” Kṛṣṇa is the fountainhead of the Supersoul also, as it will be disclosed in the following chapters, and Arjuna is the atomic soul, forgetful of his real nature; therefore he requires to be enlightened by Kṛṣṇa, or by His bona fide representative (the spiritual master)."

In Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, the lawbook for mankind, it is supported that a murderer should be condemned to death so that in his next life he will not have to suffer for the great sin he has committed. Therefore, the king\u2019s punishment of hanging a murderer is actually beneficial. Similarly, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a orders fighting, it must be concluded that violence is for supreme justice, and, as such, Arjuna should follow the instruction, knowing well that such violence, committed in the act of fighting for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is not violence at all because, at any rate, the man, or rather the soul, cannot be killed; so for the administration of justice, so-called violence is permitted.

          "Change of body by the atomic individual soul is an accepted fact. Even some of the modern scientists who do not believe in the existence of the soul, but at the same time cannot explain the source of energy from the heart, have to accept continuous changes of body which appear from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and again from youth to old age. From old age, the change is transferred to another body. This has already been explained in the previous verse.\u00a0",
          "Transference of the atomic individual soul to another body is made possible by the grace of the Supersoul.The Supersoul fulfills the desire of the atomic soul as one friend fulfills the desire of another. The Vedas, like the Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad, as well as the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upanisad, compare the soul and the Supersoul to two friendly birds sitting on the same tree. One of the birds (the individual atomic soul) is eating the fruit of the tree, and the other bird (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) is simply watching His friend. Of these two birds-although they are the same in quality-one is captivated by the fruits of the material tree, while the other is simply witnessing the activities of His friend. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the witnessing bird, and Arjuna is the eating bird. Although they are friends, one is still the master and the other is the servant. Forgetfulness of this relationship by the atomic soul is the cause of one\u2019s changing his position from one tree to another or from one body to another. The j\u012bva soul is struggling very hard on the tree of the material body, but as soon as he agrees to accept the other bird as the supreme spiritual master-as Arjuna agreed to do by voluntary surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for instruction-the subordinate bird immediately becomes free from all lamentations. Both the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad and \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad confirm this:\u00a0",
          "samāne vṛkṣe puruṣo nimagno \n ‘nīśayā śocati muhyamānaḥ \n juṣṭaṁ yadā paśyaty anyam īśam asya \n mahimānam iti vīta-śokaḥ",
          "\u201cAlthough the two birds are in the same tree, the eating bird is fully engrossed with anxiety and moroseness as the enjoyer of the fruits of the tree. But if in some way or other he turns his face to his friend who is the Lord and knows His glories-at once the suffering bird becomes free from all anxieties.\u201d Arjuna has now turned his face towards his eternal friend, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and is understanding the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from Him. And thus, hearing from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he can understand the supreme glories of the Lord and be free from lamentation.\u00a0",
          "Arjuna is advised herewith by the Lord not to lament for the bodily change of his old grandfather and his teacher. He should rather be happy to kill their bodies in the righteous fight so that they may be cleansed at once of all reactions from various bodily activities. One who lays down his life on the sacrificial altar, or in the proper battlefield, is at once cleansed of bodily reactions and promoted to a higher status of life. So there was no cause for Arjuna\u2019s lamentation.\u00a0"

Even the nuclear weapons of the modern age are classified as fire weapons, but formerly there were other weapons made of all different types of material elements.

Because they are atomic individual souls (san\u0101tana) eternally, they are prone to be covered by the illusory energy, and thus they become separated from the association of the Supreme Lord, just as the sparks of the fire, although one in quality with the fire, are prone to be extinguished when out of the fire. In the Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a, the living entities are described as separated parts and parcels of the Supreme. They are eternally so, according to the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also.

In other words, the soul is inconceivable by human experimental knowledge. The soul is consciousness and conscious-that also is the statement of the Vedas, and we have to accept that. Unlike the bodily changes, there is no change in the soul. As eternally unchangeable, the soul remains atomic in comparison to the infinite Supreme Soul. The Supreme Soul is infinite, and the atomic soul is infinitesimal. Therefore, the infinitesimal soul, being unchangeable, can never become equal to the infinite soul, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This concept is repeated in the Vedas in different ways just to confirm the stability of the conception of the soul.

          "There is always a class of philosophers, almost akin to the Buddhists, who do not believe in the separate existence of the soul beyond the body. When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spoke the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, it appears that such philosophers existed, and they were known as the Lok\u0101yatikas and Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas. These philosophers maintained that life symptoms, or soul, takes place at a certain mature condition of material combination. The modern material scientist and materialist philosophers also think similarly. According to them, the body is a combination of physical elements, and at a certain stage the life symptoms develop by interaction of the physical and chemical elements. The science of anthropology is based on this philosophy. Currently, many pseudo-religions-now becoming fashionable in America-are also adhering to this philosophy, as well as to the nihilistic nondevotional Buddhist sects.\u00a0",
          "Even if Arjuna did not believe in the existence of the soul-as in the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika philosophy-there would still have been no cause for lamentation. No one laments the loss of a certain bulk of chemicals and stops discharging his prescribed duty. On the other hand, in modern science and scientific warfare, so many tons of chemicals are wasted for achieving victory over the enemy. According to the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika philosophy, the so-called soul or \u0101tm\u0101 vanishes along with the deterioration of the body. So, in any case, whether Arjuna accepted the Vedic conclusion that there is an atomic soul, or whether he did not believe in the existence of the soul, he had no reason to lament. According to this theory, since there are so many living entities generating out of matter every moment, and so many of them are being vanquished every moment, there is no need to grieve for such an incidence. However, since he was not risking rebirth of the soul, Arjuna had no reason to be afraid of being affected with sinful reactions due to his killing his grandfather and teacher. But at the same time, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a sarcastically addressed Arjuna as mah\u0101-b\u0101hu, mighty-armed, because He, at least, did not accept the theory of the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas, which leaves aside the Vedic wisdom. As a k\u1e63atriya, Arjuna belonged to the Vedic culture, and it behooved him to continue to follow its principles.\u00a0"

          "Accepting that there are two classes of philosophers, one believing in the existence of soul and the other not believing in the existence of the soul, there is no cause for lamentation in either case. Nonbelievers in the existence of the soul are called atheists by followers of Vedic wisdom. Yet even if, for argument\u2019s sake, we accept the atheistic theory, there is still no cause for lamentation. Apart from the separate existence of the soul, the material elements remain unmanifested before creation. From this subtle state of unmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether, air is generated; from air, fire is generated; from fire, water is generated; and from water, earth becomes manifested. From the earth, many varieties of manifestations take place. Take, for example, a big skyscraper manifested from the earth. When it is dismantled, the manifestation becomes again unmanifested and remains as atoms in the ultimate stage. The law of conservation of energy remains, but in course of time things are manifested and unmanifested— that is the difference. Then what cause is there for lamentation either in the stage of manifestation or unmanifestation? Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage, things are not lost. Both at the beginning and at the end, all elements remain unmanifested, and only in the middle are they manifested, and this does not make any real material difference.\u00a0",
          "And if we accept the Vedic conclusion as stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (antavanta ime deh\u0101\u1e25) that these material bodies are perishable in due course of time (nityasyokt\u0101\u1e25 \u015bar\u012bri\u1e47a\u1e25) but that soul is eternal, then we must remember always that the body is like a dress; therefore why lament the changing of a dress? The material body has no factual existence in relation to the eternal soul. It is something like a dream. In a dream we may think of flying in the sky, or sitting on a chariot as a king, but when we wake up we can see that we are neither in the sky nor seated on the chariot. The Vedic wisdom encourages self-realization on the basis of the nonexistence of the material body. Therefore, in either case, whether one believes in the existence of the soul, or one does not believe in the existence of the soul, there is no cause for lamentation for loss of the body.\u00a0"

Owing to a gross material conception of things, most men in this age cannot imagine how such a small particle can become both so great and so small. So men look at the soul proper as wonderful either by constitution or by description. Illusioned by the material energy, people are so engrossed in subject matter for sense gratification that they have very little time to understand the question of self-understanding, even though it is a fact that without this self-understanding all activities result in ultimate defeat in the struggle for existence.

And it is still more difficult to find a man who has actually derived full benefit from knowledge of the soul, and who is able to describe the position of the soul in different aspects.

One who gives protection from harm is called k\u1e63atriya (trayate-to give protection). The k\u1e63atriyas are trained for killing in the forest. A k\u1e63atriya would go into the forest and challenge a tiger face to face and fight with the tiger with his sword. When the tiger was killed, it would be offered the royal order of cremation. This system is being followed even up to the present day by the k\u1e63atriya kings of Jaipur state. The k\u1e63atriyas are specially trained for challenging and killing because religious violence is sometimes a necessary factor. Therefore, k\u1e63atriyas are never meant for accepting directly the order of sanny\u0101sa or renunciation. Nonviolence in politics may be a diplomacy, but it is never a factor or principle. In the religious law books it is stated:\u00a0",

The animal sacrificed gets a human life immediately without undergoing the gradual evolutionary process from one form to another, and the k\u1e63atriyas killed in the battlefield also attain the heavenly planets as do the br\u0101hma\u1e47as who attain them by offering sacrifice.\u00a0",

As long as one is not liberated, one has to perform the duties of that particular body in accordance with religious principles in order to achieve liberation.

In the bodily conception of life there are specific duties for the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and k\u1e63atriyas respectively, and such duties are unavoidable. Svadharma is ordained by the Lord, and this will be clarified in the Fourth Chapter.

But if he abandoned the battle, he would not only neglect his specific duty as a k\u1e63atriya, but he would lose all his fame and good name and thus prepare his royal road to hell. In other words, he would go to hell, not by fighting, but by withdrawing from battle.\u00a0"

        "According to the Nirukti, or the Vedic dictionary, saṅkhya means that which describes phenomena in detail, and saṅkhya refers to that philosophy which describes the real nature of the soul. And yoga involves controlling the senses. Arjuna’s proposal not to fight was based on sense gratification. Forgetting his prime duty, he wanted to cease fighting because he thought that by not killing his relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by enjoying the kingdom by conquering his cousins and brothers, the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra. In both ways, the basic principles were for sense gratification. Happiness derived from conquering them and happiness derived by seeing kinsmen alive are both on the basis of persona1 sense gratification, for there is a sacrifice of wisdom and duty. Kṛṣṇa, therefore, wanted to explain to Arjuna that by killing the body of his grandfather he would not be killing the soul proper, and He explained that all individual persons, including the Lord Himself, are eternal individuals; they were individuals in the past, they are individuals in the present, and they will continue to remain individuals in the future, because all of us are individual souls eternally, and we simply change our bodily dress in different manners. But, actually, we keep our individuality even after liberation from the bondage of material dress. An analytical study of the soul and the body has been very graphically explained by Lord Kṛṣṇa. And this descriptive knowledge of the soul and the body from different angles of vision has been described here as sāṅkhya, in terms of the Nirukti dictionary. This sāṅkhya has nothing to do with the sāṅkhya philosophy of the atheist Kapila. Long before the imposter Kapila’s sāṅkhya, the sāṅkhya philosophy was expounded in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam by the true Lord Kapila, the incarnation of Lord Kṛṣṇa, who explained it to His mother, Devahūti. It is clearly explained by Him that the Puruṣa, or the Supreme Lord, is active and that He creates by looking over the prakṛti. This is accepted in the Vedas and in the Gītā. The description in the Vedas indicates that the Lord glanced over the prakṛti, or nature, and impregnated it with atomic individuals souls. All these individuals are working in the material world for sense gratification, and under the spell of material energy they are thinking of being enjoyers. This mentality is dragged to the last point of liberation when the living entity wants to become one with the Lord. This is the last snare of māyā or sense gratificatory illusion, and it is only after many, many births of such sense gratificatory activities that a great soul surrenders unto Vāsudeva, Lord Kṛṣṇa, thereby fulfilling the search after the ultimate truth. ",
        "Arjuna has already accepted Kṛṣṇa as his spiritual master by surrendering himself unto Him: śiṣyas te ‘haṁ śādhi māṁ tvāṁ prapannam. Consequently, Kṛṣṇa will now tell him about the working process in buddhi-yoga, or karma-yoga, or in other words, the practice of devotional service only for the sense gratification of the Lord. This buddhi-yoga is clearly explained in Chapter Ten, verse ten, as being direct communion with the Lord, who is sitting as Paramātmā in everyone’s heart. But such communion does not take place without devotional service. One who is therefore situated in devotional or transcendental loving service to the Lord, or, in other words, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, attains to this stage of buddhi-yoga by the special grace of the Lord. The Lord says, therefore, that only to those who are always engaged in devotional service out of transcendental love does He award the pure knowledge of devotion in love. In that way the devotee can reach Him easily in the ever-blissful kingdom of God.",
        "Thus the buddhi-yoga mentioned in this verse is the devotional service of the Lord, and the word sāṅkhya mentioned herein has nothing to do with the atheistic sāṅkhya-yoga enunciated by the impostor Kapila. One should not, therefore, misunderstand that the sāṅkhya-yoga mentioned herein has any connection with the atheistic sāṅkhya. Nor did that philosophy have any influence during that time; nor would Lord Kṛṣṇa care to mention such godless philosophical speculations. Real sāṅkhya philosophy is described by Lord Kapila in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, but even that sāṅkhya has nothing to do with the current topics. Here, sāṅkhya means analytical description of the body and the soul. Lord Kṛṣṇa made an analytical description of the soul just to bring Arjuna to the point of buddhi-yoga, or bhakti-yoga. Therefore, Lord Kṛṣṇa’s sāṅkhya and Lord Kapila’s sāṅkhya, as described in the Bhāgavatam; are one and the same. They are all bhakti-yoga. He said, therefore, that only the less intelligent class of men make a distinction between sāṅkhya-yoga and bhakti-yoga.",
        "Of course, atheistic sāṅkhya-yoga has nothing to do with bhakti-yoga, yet the unintelligent claim that the atheistic sāṅkhya-yoga is referred to in the Bhagavad-gītā.",
        "One should therefore understand that buddhi-yoga means to work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, in the full bliss and knowledge of devotional service. One who works for the satisfaction of the Lord only, however difficult such work may be, is working under the principles of buddhi-yoga and finds himself always in transcendental bliss. By such transcendental engagement, one achieves all transcendental qualities automatically, by the grace of the Lord, and thus his liberation is complete in itself, without his making extraneous endeavors to acquire knowledge. There is much difference between work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and work for fruitive results, especially in the matter of sense gratification for achieving results in terms of family or material happiness. Buddhi-yoga is therefore the transcendental quality of the work that we perform."

Even a small beginning of such activity finds no impediment, nor can that small beginning be lost at any stage.

When one is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, all activities are on the absolute plane, for they are no longer subject to dualities like good and bad.

          "As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This transcendental position is achieved in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness when one is fully dependant on the good will of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u00a0"

          "The rituals and sacrifices mentioned in the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da division of the Vedic literature are to encourage gradual development of self-realization. And the purpose of self-realization is clearly stated in the Fifteenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (Bg. 15.15)I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. By all the Vedas am I to be known; indeed I am the compiler of Ved\u0101nta, and I am the knower of the Vedas.: the purpose of studying the Vedas is to know Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the primeval cause of everything. So, self-realization means understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and one\u2019s eternal relationship with Him. The relationship of the living entities with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The living entities are parts and parcels of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore, revival of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by the individual living entity is the highest perfectional stage of Vedic knowledge. This is confirmed in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.33.7), how glorious are they whose tongues are chanting Your holy name! Even if born in the families of dog-eaters, such persons are worshipable. Persons who chant the holy name of Your Lordship must have executed all kinds of austerities and fire sacrifices and achieved all the good manners of the \u0100ryans. To be chanting the holy name of Your Lordship, they must have bathed at holy places of pilgrimage, studied the Vedas and fulfilled everything required. as follows:\u00a0",
          "aho bata śvapaco’to garīyān \n yaj-jihvāgre vartate nāma tubhyam \n tepus tapas te juhuvuḥ sasnur āryā \n brahmānūcur nāma gṛṇanti ye te.",
          "\u201cO my Lord, a person who is chanting Your holy name, although born of a low family like that of a c\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la [dog eater], is situated on the highest platform of self-realization. Such a person must have performed all kinds of penances and sacrifices according to Vedic rituals and studied the Vedic literatures many, many times after taking his bath in all the holy places of pilgrimage. Such a person is considered to be the best of the \u0100ryan family.\u201d So one must be intelligent enough to understand the purpose of the Vedas, without being attached to the rituals only, and must not desire to be elevated to the heavenly kingdoms for a better quality of sense gratification. It is not possible for the common man in this age to follow all the rules and regulations of the Vedic rituals and the injunctions of the Ved\u0101ntas and the Upani\u1e63ads. It requires much time, energy, knowledge and resources to execute the purposes of the Vedas. This is hardly possible in this age. The best purpose of Vedic culture is served, however, by chanting the holy name of the Lord, as recommended by Lord Caitanya, the deliverer of all fallen souls. When Lord Caitanya was asked by a great Vedic scholar, Prak\u0101\u015b\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b, why He, the Lord, was chanting the holy name of the Lord like a sentimentalist instead of studying Ved\u0101nta philosophy, the Lord replied that His spiritual master found Him to be a great fool, and thus he asked Him to chant the holy name of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He did so, and became ecstatic like a madman. In this age of Kali, most of the population is foolish and not adequately educated to understand Ved\u0101nta philosophy; the best purpose of Ved\u0101nta philosophy is served by inoffensively chanting the holy name of the Lord. Ved\u0101nta is the last word in Vedic wisdom, and the author and knower of the Ved\u0101nta philosophy is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; and the highest Vedantist is the great soul who takes pleasure in chanting the holy name of the Lord. That is the ultimate purpose of all Vedic mysticism.\u00a0"

Capricious work means actions without the sanction of authority, and inaction means not performing one\u2019s prescribed duties. The Lord advised that Arjuna not be inactive, but that he perform his prescribed duty without being attached to the result. One who is attached to the result of his work is also the cause of the action. Thus he is the enjoyer or sufferer of the result of such actions.\u00a0",
          "As far as prescribed duties are concerned, they can be fitted into three subdivisions, namely routine work, emergency work and desired activities. Routine work, in terms of the scriptural injunctions, is done without desire for results. As one has to do it, obligatory work is action in the mode of goodness. Work with results becomes the cause of bondage; therefore such work is not auspicious. Everyone has his proprietory right in regard to prescribed duties, but should act without attachment to the result; such disinterested obligatory duties doubtlessly lead one to the path of liberation.\u00a0",
          "Arjuna was therefore advised by the Lord to fight as a matter of duty without attachment to the result. His nonparticipation in the battle is another side of attachment. Such attachment never leads one to the path of salvation. Any attachment, positive or negative, is cause for bondage. Inaction is sinful. Therefore, fighting as a matter of duty was the only auspicious path of salvation for Arjuna.\u00a0"

Out of ignorance only, less intelligent persons try to adjust to the situation by fruitive activities, thinking that resultant actions will make them happy. They do not know that no kind of material body anywhere within the universe can give life without miseries. The miseries of life, namely birth, death, old age and diseases, are present everywhere within the material world. But one who understands his real constitutional position as the eternal servitor of the Lord, and thus knows the position of the Personality of Godhead, engages himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Consequently he becomes qualified to enter into the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets, where there is neither material, miserable life, nor the influence of time and death. To know one\u2019s constitutional position means to know also the sublime position of the Lord. One who wrongly thinks that the living entity\u2019s position and the Lord\u2019s position are on the same level is to be understood to be in darkness and therefore unable to engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord. He becomes a lord himself and thus paves the way for the repetition of birth and death. But one who, understanding that his position is to serve, transfers himself to the service of the Lord, at once becomes eligible for Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhaloka. Service for the cause of the Lord is called karma-yoga or buddhi-yoga, or in plain words, devotional service to the Lord.\u00a0"

          "The word muni means one who can agitate his mind in various ways for mental speculation without coming to a factual conclusion. It is said that every muni has a different angle of vision, and unless a muni differs from other munis, he cannot be called a muni in the strict sense of the term. N\u0101sau munir yasya mata\u1e41 na binnam. But a sthita-dh\u012b-muni as mentioned herein by the Lord, is different from an ordinary muni. The sthita-dh\u012b-muni is always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, for he has exhausted all his business of creative speculation. He has surpassed the stage of mental speculations and has come to the conclusion that Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or V\u0101sudeva, is everything. He is called a muni fixed in mind. Such a fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is not at all disturbed by the onslaughts of the threefold miseries, for he accepts all miseries as the mercy of the Lord, thinking himself only worthy of more trouble due to his past misdeeds; and he sees that his miseries, by the grace of the Lord, are minimized to the lowest. Similarly, when he is happy he gives credit to the Lord, thinking himself unworthy of the happiness; he realizes that it is due only to the Lord\u2019s grace that he is in such a comfortable condition and able to render better service to the Lord. And, for the service of the Lord, he is always daring and active and is not influenced by attachment or aversion. Attachment means accepting things for one\u2019s own sense gratification, and detachment is the absence of such sensual attachment. But one fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has neither attachment nor detachment because his life is dedicated in the service of the Lord. Consequently he is not at all angry even when his attempts are unsuccessful. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is always steady in his determination.\u00a0"

Most people, however, are servants of the senses and are thus directed by the dictation of the senses. That is the answer to the question as to how the yog\u012b is situated. The senses are compared to venomous serpents. They want to act very loosely and without restriction. The yog\u012b, or the devotee, must be very strong to control the serpents-like a snake charmer. He never allows them to act independently. There are many injunctions in the revealed scriptures; some of them are do-not\u2019s, and some of them are do\u2019s. Unless one is able to follow the do\u2019s and the do-not\u2019s, restricting oneself from sense enjoyment, it is not possible to be firmly fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.

          "One who is not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is subjected to material desires while contemplating the objects of senses. The senses require real engagements, and if they are not engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, they will certainly seek engagement in the service of materialism. In the material world everyone, including Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101-to say nothing of other demigods in the heavenly planets-is subjected to the influence of sense objects, and the only method to get out of this puzzle of material existence is to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Lord \u015aiva was deep in meditation, but when P\u0101rvat\u012b agitated him for sense pleasure, he agreed to the proposal, and as a result K\u0101rtikeya was born. When Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kur was a young devotee of the Lord, he was similarly allured by the incarnation of M\u0101y\u0101 Dev\u012b, but Harid\u0101sa easily passed the test because of his unalloyed devotion to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

That is the secret of success. One who is not, therefore, in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however powerful he may be in controlling the senses by artificial repression, is sure ultimately to fail, for the slightest thought of sense pleasure will agitate him to gratify his desires.\u00a0"

Those who are without knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness artificially try to avoid material objects, and as a result, although they desire liberation from material bondage, they do not attain to the perfect stage of renunciation. On the other hand, a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness knows how to use everything in the service of the Lord; therefore he does not become a victim of material consciousness. For example, for an impersonalist, the Lord, or the Absolute, being impersonal, cannot eat. Whereas an impersonalist tries to avoid good eatables, a devotee knows that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme enjoyer and that He eats all that is offered to Him in devotion. So, after offering good eatables to the Lord, the devotee takes the remnants, called pras\u0101dam. Thus everything becomes spiritualized and there is no danger of a downfall. The devotee takes pras\u0101dam in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, whereas the nondevotee rejects it as material. The impersonalist, therefore, cannot enjoy life due to his artificial renunciation; and for this reason, a slight agitation of the mind pulls him down again into the pool of material existence. It is said that such a soul, even though rising up to the point of liberation, falls down again due to his not having support in devotional service.\u00a0"

That is the proof of a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious man— one who has lost all inclinations for material sense gratification, although the desires are present. Because he remains satisfied in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, he can remain steady, like the ocean, and therefore enjoy full peace. Others, however, who fulfill desires even up to the limit of liberation, what to speak of material success, never attain peace. The fruitive workers, the salvationists, and also the yog\u012bs who are after mystic powers, are all unhappy because of unfulfilled desires. But the person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is happy in the service of the Lord, and he has no desires to be fulfilled. In fact, he does not even desire liberation from the so-called material bondage. The devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a have no material desires, and therefore they are in perfect peace.\u00a0"

          "To become desireless means not to desire anything for sense gratification. In other words, desire for becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is actually desirelessness. To understand one\u2019s actual position as the eternal servitor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, without falsely claiming this material body to be oneself and without falsely claiming proprietorship over anything in the world, is the perfect stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One who is situated in this perfect stage knows that because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the proprietor of everything, therefore everything must be used for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Arjuna did not want to fight for his own sense satisfaction, but when he became fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious he fought because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted him to fight. For himself there was no desire to fight, but for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the same Arjuna fought to his best ability. Desire for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is really desirelessness; it is not an artificial attempt to abolish desires. The living entity cannot be desireless or senseless, but he does have to change the quality of the desires. A materially desireless person certainly knows that everything belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (\u012b\u015b\u0101v\u0101syam ida\u1e41 sarvam), and therefore he does not falsely claim proprietorship over anything. This transcendental knowledge is based on self-realization— namely, knowing perfectly well that every living entity is the eternal part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in spiritual identity. and therefore the eternal position of the living entity is never on the level of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or greater than Him.

It is only a matter of understanding and accepting the fact. Kha\u1e6dv\u0101\u1e45ga Mah\u0101r\u0101ja attained this state of life just a few minutes before his death, by surrendering unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a means ending the process of materialistic life. According to Buddhist philosophy, there is only void after the completion of this material life, but Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 teaches differently. Actual life begins after the completion of this material life. For the gross materialist it is sufficient to know that one has to end this materialistic way of life, but for persons who are spiritually advanced, there is another life after this materialistic life. Before ending this life, if one fortunately becomes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, he at once attains the stage of Brahma-nirv\u0101\u1e47a. There is no difference between the kingdom of God and the devotional service of the Lord. Since both of them are on the absolute plane, to be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord is to have attained the spiritual kingdom. In the material world there are activities of sense gratification, whereas in the spiritual world there are activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Attainment of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness even during this life is immediate attainment of Brahman, and one who is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has certainly already entered into the kingdom of God.\u00a0",

      "The Supreme Personality of Godhead \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has very elaborately described the constitution of the soul in the previous chapter, with a view to deliver His intimate friend Arjuna from the ocean of material grief. And the path of realization has been recommended: buddhi-yoga, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Sometimes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is misunderstood to be inertia, and one with such a misunderstanding often withdraws to a secluded place to become fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious by chanting the holy name of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But without being trained in the philosophy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, it is not advisable to chant the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in a secluded place where one may acquire only cheap adoration from the innocent public. Arjuna also thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness or buddhi-yoga, or intelligence in spiritual advancement of knowledge, as something like retirement from active life and the practice of penance and austerity at a secluded place. In other words, he wanted to skillfully avoid the fighting by using K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness as an excuse. But as a sincere student, he placed the matter before his master and questioned K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as to his best course of action. In answer, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a elaborately explained karma-yoga, or work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, in this Third Chapter.\u00a0"

      "In the Second Chapter, verse 39, the Lord explained two kinds of procedures-namely s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga and karma-yoga, or buddhi-yoga. In this verse, the Lord explains the same more clearly. S\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga, or the analytical study of the nature of spirit and matter, is the subject matter for persons who are inclined to speculate and understand things by experimental knowledge and philosophy. The other class of men work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, as it is explained in the 61st verse of the Second Chapter. The Lord has explained, also in the 39th verse, that by working by the principles of buddhi-yoga, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can be relieved from the bonds of action; and, furthermore, there is no flaw in the process. The same principle is more clearly explained in the 61st verse-that this buddhi-yoga is to depend entirely on the Supreme (or more specifically, on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a), and in this way all the senses can be brought under control very easily. Therefore, both the yogas are interdependant, as religion and philosophy. Religion without philosophy is sentiment, or sometimes fanaticism, while philosophy without religion is mental speculation. The ultimate goal is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because the philosophers who are also sincerely searching after the Absolute Truth come in the end to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This is also stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The whole process is to understand the real position of the self in relation to the Superself. The indirect process is philosophical speculation, by which, gradually, one may come to the point of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; and the other process is directly connecting with everything in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Of these two, the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is better because it does not depend on purifying the senses by a philosophical process. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is itself the purifying process, and by the direct method of devotional service it is simultaneously easy and sublime.\u00a0"

But if the soul is engaged in his natural function of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, whatever he is able to do is good for him. The \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam affirms this:\u00a0",

But if he carries out all the injunctions for purification in the \u015b\u0101stras, what does it avail him if he is not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious?\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.5.17) One who has forsaken his material occupations to engage in the devotional service of the Lord may sometimes fall down while in an immature stage, yet there is no danger of his being unsuccessful. On the other hand, a nondevotee, though fully engaged in occupational duties, does not gain anything. So the purificatory process is necessary for reaching this point of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Therefore, sanny\u0101sa, or any purificatory process, is to help reach the ultimate goal of becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, without which everything is considered a failure.\u00a0"

Such activities gradually cleanse the heart of a mundane man and free him from material contamination. So-called renunciation for the purpose of maintenance is never approved by the Lord, nor by any religious scripture. After all, one has to maintain one\u2019s body and soul together by some work. Work should not be given up capriciously, without purification of materialistic propensities. Anyone who is in the material world is certainly possessed of the impure propensity for lording it over material nature, or, in other words, for sense gratification. Such polluted propensities have to be cleared. Without doing so, through prescribed duties, one should never attempt to become a so-called transcendentalist, renouncing work and living at the cost of others.\u00a0"

      "Since one has to work even for the simple maintenance of the body, the prescribed duties for a particular social position and quality are so made that that purpose can be fulfilled. Yaj\u00f1a means Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or sacrificial performances. All sacrificial performances also are meant for the satisfaction of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The Vedas enjoin: yaj\u00f1o vai vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u1e25. In other words, the same purpose is served whether one performs prescribed yaj\u00f1as or directly serves Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is therefore performance of yaj\u00f1a as it is prescribed in this verse. The var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution also aims at this for satisfying Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. \u201cVar\u1e47\u0101\u015bram\u0101c\u0101ra-vat\u0101 puru\u1e63e\u1e47a para\u1e25 pum\u0101n/vi\u1e63\u1e47ur \u0101r\u0101dhyate\u2026\u201d (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a 3.8.8) Therefore one has to work for the satisfaction of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Any other work done in this material world wilI be a cause of bondage, for both good and evil work have their reactions, and any reaction binds the performer. Therefore, one has to work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u); and while performing such activities one is in a liberated stage. This is the great art of doing work, and in the beginning this process requires very expert guidance. One should therefore act very diligently, under the expert guidance of a devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or under the direct instruction of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself (under whom Arjuna had the opportunity to work). Nothing should be performed for sense gratification, but everything should be done for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This practice will not only save one from the reaction of work, but will also gradually elevate one to transcendental loving service of the Lord, which alone can raise one to the kingdom of God.\u00a0"

      "The material creation by the Lord of creatures (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u) is a chance offered to the conditioned souls to come back home-back to Godhead. All living entities within the material creation are conditioned by material nature because of their forgetfulness of their relationship to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Vedic principles are to help us understand this eternal relation as it is stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25. The Lord says that the purpose of the Vedas is to understand Him. In the Vedic hymns it is said: pati\u1e41 vi\u015bvasy\u0101tme\u015bvaram. Therefore, the Lord of the living entities is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b describes the Lord as pati in so many ways:\u00a0",
      "śriyaḥ-patir yajña-patiḥ prajā-patir \n dhiyāṁ patir loka-patir dharā-patiḥ \n patir gatiś cāndhaka-vṛṣṇi-sātvatāṁ \n prasīdatāṁ me bhagavān satāṁ patiḥ \n (Bhāg. 2.4.20)",
      "The praj\u0101-pati is Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and He is the Lord of all living creatures, all worlds, and all beauties, and the protector of everyone. The Lord created this material world for the conditioned souls to learn how to perform yaj\u00f1as (sacrifice) for the satisfaction of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, so that while in the material world they can live very comfortably without anxiety. Then after finishing the present material body, they can enter into the kingdom of God. That is the whole program for the conditioned soul. By performance of yaj\u00f1a, the conditioned souls gradually become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and become godly in all respects. In this age of Kali, the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a (the chanting of the names of God) is recommended by the Vedic scriptures, and this transcendental system was introduced by Lord Caitanya for the deliverance of all men in this age. Sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness go well together. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His devotional form (as Lord Caitanya) is mentioned in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam as follows, with special reference to the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a:\u00a0",

      "The demigods are authorized supplying agents on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Therefore, they must be satisfied by the performance of prescribed yaj\u00f1as. In the Vedas, there are different kinds of yaj\u00f1as prescribed for different kinds of demigods, but all are ultimately offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For one who cannot understand what the Personality of Godhead is, sacrifice to the demigods is recommended. According to the different material qualities of the persons concerned, different types of yaj\u00f1as are recommended in the Vedas. Worship of different demigods is also on the same basis-namely, according to different qualities. For example, the meat-eaters are recommended to worship the goddess K\u0101l\u012b, the ghastly form of material nature, and before the goddess the sacrifice of animals is recommended. But for those who are in the mode of goodness, the transcendental worship of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is recommended. But ultimately, all yaj\u00f1as are meant for gradual promotion to the transcendental position. For ordinary men, at least five yaj\u00f1as, known as pa\u00f1ca-mah\u0101yaj\u00f1a, are necessary.\u00a0",
      "One should know, however, that all the necessities of life that the human society requires are supplied by the demigod agents of the Lord. No one can manufacture anything. Take, for example, all the eatables of human society. These eatables include grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, sugar, etc., for the persons in the mode of goodness, and also eatables for the nonvegetarians, like meats, etc., none of which can be manufactured by men. Then again, take for example heat, light, water, air, etc., which are also necessities of life-none of them can be manufactured by the human society. Without the Supreme Lord, there can be no profuse sunlight, moonlight, rainfall, breeze, etc., without which no one can live. Obviously, our life is dependant on supplies from the Lord. Even for our manufacturing enterprises, we require so many raw materials like metal, sulphur, mercury, manganese, and so many essentials-all of which are supplied by the agents of the Lord, with the purpose that we should make proper use of them to keep ourselves fit and healthy for the purpose of self-realization, leading to the ultimate goal of life, namely, liberation from the material struggle for existence. This aim of life is attained by performance of yaj\u00f1as. If we forget the purpose of human life and simply take supplies from the agents of the Lord for sense gratification and become more and more entangled in material existence, which is not the purpose of creation, certainly we become thieves, and therefore we are punished by the laws of material nature. A society of thieves can never be happy because they have no aim in life. The gross materialist thieves have no ultimate goal of life. They are simply directed to sense gratification; nor do they have knowledge of how to perform yaj\u00f1as. Lord Caitanya, however, inaugurated the easiest performance of yaj\u00f1a, namely the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a, which can be performed by anyone in the world who accepts the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u00a0"

      "\u015ar\u012bla Baladeva Vidy\u0101bh\u016b\u1e63a\u1e47a, a great commentator on the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, writes as follows: ye indr\u0101dy-a\u1e45ga-tay\u0101vasthita\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a\u1e41 sarve\u015bvara\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47um abhyarccya tacche\u1e63am a\u015bnanti tena taddeha-y\u0101ntr\u0101\u1e41 samp\u0101dayanti te santa\u1e25 sarve\u015bvarasya bhakt\u0101\u1e25 sarva-kilvi\u1e63air an\u0101di-k\u0101la-viv\u1e5bddhair \u0101tm\u0101nubhava- pratibandhakair nikhilai\u1e25 p\u0101pair vimucyante. The Supreme Lord, who is known as the yaj\u00f1a-puru\u1e63a\u1e25, or the personal beneficiary of all sacrifices, is the master of all demigods who serve Him as the different limbs of the body serve the whole. Demigods like Indra, Candra, Varu\u1e47a, etc., are appointed officers who manage material affairs, and the Vedas direct sacrifices to satisfy these demigods so that they may be pleased to supply air, light and water sufficiently to produce food grains. When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is worshiped, the demigods, who are different limbs of the Lord, are also automatically worshiped; therefore there is no separate need to worship the demigods. For this reason, the devotees of the Lord, who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, offer food to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and then eat-a process which nourishes the body spiritually. By such action not only are past sinful reactions in the body vanquished, but the body becomes immunized to all contamination of material nature. When there is an epidemic disease, an antiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack of such an epidemic. Similarly, food offered to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and then taken by us makes us sufficiently resistant to material affection, and one who is accustomed to this practice is called a devotee of the Lord. Therefore, a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, who eats only food offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, can counteract all reactions of past material infections, which are impediments to the progress of self-realization. On the other hand, one who does not do so continues to increase the volume of sinful action, and this prepares the next body to resemble hogs and dogs, to suffer the resultant reactions of all sins. The material world is full of contaminations, and one who is immunized by accepting pras\u0101dam of the Lord (food offered to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u) is saved from the attack, whereas one who does not do so becomes subjected to contamination.\u00a0",
      "Food grains or vegetables are factually eatables. The human being eats different kinds of food grains, vegetables, fruits, etc., and the animals eat the refuse of the food grains and vegetables, grass, plants, etc. Human beings who are accustomed to eating meat and flesh must also depend on the production of vegetation in order to eat the animals. Therefore, ultimately, we have to depend on the production of the field and not on the production of big factories. The field production is due to sufficient rain from the sky, and such rains are controlled by demigods like Indra, sun, moon, etc., and they are all servants of the Lord. The Lord can be satisfied by sacrifices; therefore, one who cannot perform them will find himself in scarcity-that is the law of nature. Yaj\u00f1a, specifically the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a prescribed for this age, must therefore be performed to save us at least from scarcity of food supply.\u00a0"

      "Yaj\u00f1\u0101rtha karma, or the necessity of work for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a only, is more expressly stated in this verse. If we have to work for the satisfaction of the yaj\u00f1a-puru\u1e63a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, then we must find out the direction of work in Brahman, or the transcendental Vedas. The Vedas are therefore codes of working directions. Anything performed without the direction of the Vedas is called vikarma, or unauthorized or sinful work. Therefore, one should always take direction from the Vedas to be saved from the reaction of work. As one has to work in ordinary life by the direction of the state, similarly, one has to work under direction of the supreme state of the Lord. Such directions in the Vedas are directly manifested from the breathing of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is said: asya mahato bh\u016btasya na\u015bvasitam etad yad \u1e5bg-vedo yajur-veda\u1e25 s\u0101ma-vedo \u2018tharv\u0101\u1e45 girasa\u1e25. \u201cThe four Vedas-namely the \u1e5ag-veda, Yajur-veda, S\u0101ma-veda and Atharva-veda— are all emanations from the breathing of the great Personality of Godhead.\u201d The Lord, being omnipotent, can speak by breathing air, as it is confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, for the Lord has the omnipotence to perform through each of His senses the actions of all other senses. In other words, the Lord can speak through His breathing, and He can impregnate by His eyes. In fact, it is said that He glanced over material nature and thus fathered all living entities. After creating or impregnating the conditioned souls into the womb of material nature, He gave His directions in the Vedic wisdom as to how such conditioned souls can return home, back to Godhead. We should always remember that the conditioned souls in material nature are all eager for material enjoyment. But the Vedic directions are so made that one can satisfy one\u2019s perverted desires, then return to Godhead, having finished his so-called enjoyment. It is a chance for the conditioned souls to attain liberation; therefore the conditioned souls must try to follow the process of yaj\u00f1a by becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Even those who cannot follow the Vedic injunctions may adopt the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and that will take the place of performance of Vedic yaj\u00f1as, or karmas.\u00a0"

      "The mammonist philosophy of work very hard and enjoy sense gratification is condemned herein by the Lord. Therefore, for those who want to enjoy this material world, the above-mentioned cycle of performing yaj\u00f1as is absolutely necessary. One who does not follow such regulations is living a very risky life, being condemned more and more. By nature\u2019s law, this human form of life is specifically meant for self-realization, in either of the three ways-namely karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, or bhakti-yoga. There is no necessity of rigidly following the performances of the prescribed yaj\u00f1as for the transcendentalists who are above vice and virtue; but those who are engaged in sense gratification require purification by the above-mentioned cycle of yaj\u00f1a performances. There are different kinds of activities. Those who are not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious are certainly engaged in sensory consciousness; therefore they need to execute pious work. The yaj\u00f1a system is planned in such a way that sensory conscious persons may satisfy their desires without becoming entangled in the reaction of sense-gratificatory work. The prosperity of the world depends not on our own efforts but on the background arrangement of the Supreme Lord, directly carried out by the demigods. Therefore, the yaj\u00f1as are directly aimed at the particular demigod mentioned in the Vedas. Indirectly, it is the practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, because when one masters the performance of yaj\u00f1as, one is sure to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. But if by performing yaj\u00f1as one does not become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, such principles are counted as only moral codes. One should not, therefore, limit his progress only to the point of moral codes, but should transcend them, to attain K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u00a0"

      "Var\u1e47a-sa\u1e45kara is unwanted population which disturbs the peace of the general society. In order to check this social disturbance, there are prescribed rules and regulations by which the population can automatically become peaceful and organized for spiritual progress in life. When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends, naturally He deals with such rules and regulations in order to maintain the prestige and necessity of such important performances. The Lord is the father of all living entities, and if the living entities are misguided, indirectly the responsibility goes to the Lord. Therefore, whenever there is general disregard of regulative principles, the Lord Himself descends and corrects the society. We should, however, note carefully that although we have to follow in the footsteps of the Lord, we still have to remember that we cannot imitate Him. Following and imitating are not on the same level. We cannot imitate the Lord by lifting Govardhana Hill, as the Lord did in His childhood. It is impossible for any human being. We have to follow His instructions, but we may not imitate Him at any time. The \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam affirms:\u00a0",

      "We should always consider the position of the \u012b\u015bvaras, or those who can actually control the movements of the sun and moon, as superior. Without such power, one cannot imitate the \u012b\u015bvaras, who are superpowerful. Lord \u015aiva drank poison to the extent of swallowing an ocean, but if any common man tries to drink even a fragment of such poison, he will be killed. There are many psuedo-devotees of Lord \u015aiva who want to indulge in smoking g\u0101\u00f1j\u0101 (marijuana) and similar intoxicating drugs, forgetting that by so imitating the acts of Lord \u015aiva they are calling death very near. Similarly, there are some psuedo-devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who prefer to imitate the Lord in His r\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101, or dance of love, forgetting their inability to lift Govardhana Hill. It is best, therefore, that one not try to imitate the powerful, but simply follow their instructions; nor should one try to occupy their posts without qualification.

      "This verse clearly indicates the purpose of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The Lord instructs that one has to become fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious to discharge duties, as if in military discipline. Such an injunction may make things a little difficult; nevertheless duties must be carried out, with dependence on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because that is the constitutional position of the living entity. The living entity cannot be happy independant of the cooperation of the Supreme Lord because the eternal constitutional position of the living entity is to become subordinate to the desires of the Lord. Arjuna was, therefore, ordered by \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to fight as if the Lord were his military commander. One has to sacrifice everything for the good will of the Supreme Lord, and at the same time discharge prescribed duties without claiming proprietorship. Arjuna did not have to consider the order of the Lord; he had only to execute His order. The Supreme Lord is the Soul of all souls; therefore, one who depends solely and wholly on the Supreme Soul without personal consideration, or in other words, one who is fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, is called adhy\u0101tma-cetas\u0101. Nir\u0101\u015b\u012b\u1e25 means that one has to act on the order of the master. Nor should one ever expect fruitive results. The cashier may count millions of dollars for his employer, but he does not claim a cent for himself. Similarly, one has to realize that nothing in the world belongs to any individual person, but that everything belongs to the Supreme Lord. That is the real purport of mayi, or unto Me. And when one acts in such K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, certainly he does not claim proprietorship over anything. This consciousness is called nirmama, or nothing is mine. And, if there is any reluctance to execute such a stern order which is without consideration of so-called kinsmen in the bodily relationship, that reluctance should be thrown off; in this way one may become vigata-jvara, or without feverish mentality or lethargy. Everyone, according to his quality and position, has a particular type of work to discharge, and all such duties may be discharged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, as described above. That will lead one to the path of liberation.\u00a0"

Therefore, even for the most highly educated person on the mundane plane, it is impossible to get out of the entanglement of m\u0101y\u0101 simply by theoretical knowledge, or by separating the soul from the body.

But those who are not in such consciousness should follow the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures. Unrestricted sense enjoyment is the cause of material encagement, but one who follows the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures does not become entangled by the sense objects. For example, sex enjoyment is a necessity for the conditioned soul, and sex enjoyment is allowed under the license of marriage ties. For example, according to scriptural injunctions, one is forbidden to engage in sex relationships with any women other than one\u2019s wife. All other women are to be considered as one\u2019s mother. But, in spite of such injunctions, a man is still inclined to have sex relationships with other women. These propensities are to be curbed; otherwise they will be stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization. As long as the material body is there, the necessities of the material body are allowed, but under rules and regulations. And yet, we should not rely upon the control of such allowances. One has to follow those rules and regulations, unattached to them, because practice of sense gratifications under regulations may also lead one to go astray-as much as there is always the chance of an accident, even on the royal roads. Although they may be very carefully maintained, no one can guarantee that there will be no danger even on the safest road. The sense enjoyment spirit has been current a very long, long time, owing to material association. Therefore, in spite of regulated sense enjoyment, there is every chance of falling down; therefore any attachment for regulated sense enjoyment must also be avoided by all means.

But both materially or spiritually, one should stick to his prescribed duties even up to death, rather than imitate another\u2019s prescribed duties. Duties on the spiritual platform and duties on the material platform may be different, but the principle of following the authorized direction is always good for the performer. When one is under the spell of the modes of material nature, one should follow the prescribed rules for particular situations and should not imitate others. For example, a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, who is in the mode of goodness, is nonviolent, whereas a k\u1e63atriya, who is in the mode of passion, is allowed to be violent. As such, for a k\u1e63atriya it is better to be vanquished following the rules of violence than to imitate a br\u0101hma\u1e47a who follows the principles of nonviolence. Everyone has to cleanse his heart by a gradual process, not abruptly.

In that complete stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the k\u1e63atriya may act as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, or a br\u0101hma\u1e47a may act as a k\u1e63atriya. In the transcendental stage, the distinctions of the material world do not apply. For example, Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra was originally a k\u1e63atriya, but later on he acted as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, whereas Para\u015bur\u0101ma was a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, but later on he acted as a k\u1e63atriya. Being transcendentally situated, they could do so; but as long as one is on the material platform, he must perform his duties according to the modes of material nature. At the same time, he must have a full sense of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u00a0"

      "A living entity, as part and parcel of the Supreme, is originally spiritual, pure, and free from all material contaminations. Therefore, by nature he is not subjected to the sins of the material world. But when he is in contact with the material nature, he acts in many sinful ways without hesitation, and sometimes even against his will. As such, Arjuna\u2019s question to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very sanguine, as to the perverted nature of the living entities. Although the living entity sometimes does not want to act in sin, he is still forced to act.

      "When a living entity comes in contact with the material creation, his eternal love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transformed into lust, in association with the mode of passion. Or, in other words, the sense of love of God becomes transformed into lust, as milk in contact with sour tamarind is transformed into yogurt. Then again, when lust is unsatisfied, it turns into wrath; wrath is transformed into illusion, and illusion continues the material existence. Therefore, lust is the greatest enemy of the living entity, and it is lust only which induces the pure living entity to remain entangled in the material world. Wrath is the manifestation of the mode of ignorance; these modes exhibit themselves as wrath and other corollaries. If, therefore, the modes of passion, instead of being degraded into the modes of ignorance, are elevated to the modes of goodness by the prescribed method of Iiving and acting, then one can be saved from the degradation of wrath by spiritual attachment.\u00a0",
      "The Supreme Personality of Godhead expanded Himself into many for His ever-increasing spiritual bliss, and the living entities are parts and parcels of this spiritual bliss. They also have partial independence, but by misuse of their independence, when the service attitude is transformed into the propensity for sense enjoyment, they come under the sway of lust. This material creation is created by the Lord to give a facility to the conditioned souls to fulfill these lustful propensities, and when they are completely baffled by prolonged lustful activities, the living entities begin to inquire about their real position.\u00a0",
      "This inquiry is the beginning of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras, wherein it is said, ath\u0101to brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101: one should inquire into the Supreme.

      "There are three degrees of covering of the living entity by which his pure consciousness is obscured. This covering is but lust under different manifestations like smoke in the fire, dust on the mirror, and the womb about the embryo. When lust is compared to smoke, it is understood that the fire of the living spark can be a little perceived. In other words, when the living entity exhibits his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness slightly, he may be likened to the fire covered by smoke. Although fire is necessary where there is smoke, there is no overt manifestation of fire in the early stage. This stage is like the beginning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The dust on the mirror refers to a cleansing process of the mirror of the mind by so many spiritual methods. The best process is to chant the holy names of the Lord. The embryo covered by the womb is an analogy illustrating a helpless position, for the child in the womb is so helpless that he cannot even move. This stage of living condition can be compared to that of the trees. The trees are also living entities, but they have been put in such a condition of life by such a great exhibition of lust that they are almost void of all consciousness. The covered mirror is compared to the birds and beasts, and the smoke covered fire is compared to the human being. In the form of a human being, the living entity may revive a little K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and, if he makes further development, the fire of spiritual life can be kindled in the human form of life. By careful handling of the smoke in the fire, the fire can be made to blaze. Therefore the human form of life is a chance for the living entity to escape the entanglement of material existence. In the human form of life, one can conquer the enemy, lust, by cultivation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness under able guidance.\u00a0"

The living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord, and therefore they are simply meant to serve the Lord. This consciousness is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. So, from the very beginning of life one has to learn this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and thereby one may become fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and act accordingly.\u00a0",
      "Lust is only the perverted reflection of the love of God which is natural for every living entity. But if one is educated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness from the very beginning, that natural love of God cannot deteriorate into lust. When love of God deteriorates into lust, it is very difficult to return to the normal condition. Nonetheless, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is so powerful that even a late beginner can become a lover of God by following the regulative principles of devotional service. So, from any stage of life, or from the time of understanding its urgency, one can begin regulating the senses in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, devotional service of the Lord, and turn the lust into love of Godhead-the highest perfectional stage of human life.\u00a0"

      "The senses are different outlets for the activities of lust. Lust is reserved within the body, but it is given vent through the senses. Therefore, the senses are superior to the body as a whole. These outlets are not in use when there is superior consciousness, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness the soul makes direct connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the bodily functions, as described here, ultimately end in the Supreme Soul. Bodily action means the functions of the senses, and stopping the senses means stopping all bodily actions. But since the mind is active, then, even though the body may be silent and at rest, the mind will act-as it does during dreaming. But, above the mind there is the determination of the intelligence, and above the intelligence is the soul proper. If, therefore, the soul is directly engaged with the Supreme, naturally all other subordinates, namely, the intelligence, mind and the senses, will be automatically engaged. In the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad there is a passage in which it is said that the objects of sense gratification are superior to the senses, and mind is superior to the sense objects. If, therefore, the mind is directly engaged in the service of the Lord constantly, then there is no chance of the senses becoming engaged in other ways. This mental attitude has already been explained. If the mind is engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord, there is no chance of its being engaged in the lower propensities. In the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad the soul has been described as mah\u0101n, the great. Therefore the soul is above all-namely, the sense objects, the senses, the mind and the intelligence. Therefore, directly understanding the constitutional position of the soul is the solution of the whole problem.\u00a0",
      "With intelligence one has to seek out the constitutional position of the soul and then engage the mind always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That solves the whole problem. A neophyte spiritualist is generally advised to keep aloof from the objects of senses. One has to strengthen the mind by use of intelligence. If by intelligence one engages one\u2019s mind in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, by complete surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then, automatically, the mind becomes stronger, and even though the senses are very strong, like serpents, they will be no more effective than serpents with broken fangs. But even though the soul is the master of intelligence and mind, and the senses also, still, unless it is strengthened by association with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there is every chance of falling down due to the agitated mind.\u00a0"

In the material existence of life, one is certainly influenced by propensities for lust and desire for dominating the resources of material nature.

One may not give up work and prescribed duties all of a sudden; but by gradually developing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can be situated in a transcendental position without being influenced by the material senses and the mind— by steady intelligence directed toward one\u2019s pure identity. This is the sum total of this chapter.

The G\u012bt\u0101 is not, therefore, a speculative treatise for the insignificant mundane scholar but is a standard book of knowledge coming down from time immemorial. In the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata (\u015a\u0101nti-parva 348.51-52) we can trace out the history of the G\u012bt\u0101 as follows:\u00a0",

      "“In the beginning of the Tretā-yuga [millennium] this science of the relationship with the Supreme was delivered by Vivasvān to Manu. Manu, being the father of mankind, gave it to his son Mahārāja Ikṣvāku, the King of this earth planet and forefather of the Raghu dynasty in which Lord Rāmacandra appeared. Therefore, Bhagavad-gītā existed in the human society from the time of Mahārāja Ikṣvāku.” ",
      "At the present moment we have just passed through five thousand years of the Kali-yuga, which lasts 432,000 years. Before this there was Dvāpara-yuga (800,000 years), and before that there was Tretā-yuga (1,200,000 years). Thus, some 2,005,000 years ago, Manu spoke the Bhagavad-gītā to his disciple and son Mahārāja lkṣvāku, the King of this planet earth. The age of the current Manu is calculated to last some 305,300,000 years, of which 120,400,000 have passed. Accepting that before the birth of Manu, the Gītā was spoken by the Lord to His disciple, the sun-god Vivasvān, a rough estimate is that the Gītā was spoken at least 120,400,000 years ago; and in human society it has been extant for two million years. It was respoken by the Lord again to Arjuna about five thousand years ago. That is the rough estimate of the history of the Gīta, according to the Gītā itself and according to the version of the speaker, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. It was spoken to the sun-god Vivasvān because he is also a kṣatriya and is the father of all kṣatriyas who are descendants of the sun-god, or the sūrya-vaṁśa kṣatriyas. Because Bhagavad-gītā is as good as the Vedas, being spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this knowledge is apauruṣeya, superhuman. Since the Vedic instructions are accepted as they are, without human interpretation, the Gītā must therefore be accepted without mundane interpretation. The mundane wranglers may speculate on the Gītā in their own ways, but that is not Bhagavad-gītā as it is. Therefore, Bhagavad-gītā has to be accepted as it is, from the disciplic succession, and it is described herein that the Lord spoke to the sun-god, the sun-god spoke to his son Manu, and Manu spoke to his son Ikṣvāku."

      "Arjuna is an accepted devotee of the Lord, so how could he not believe K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s words? The fact is that Arjuna is not inquiring for himself but for those who do not believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead or for the demons who do not like the idea that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should be accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead; for them only Arjuna inquires on this point, as if he were himself not aware of the Personality of Godhead, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As it will be evident from the Tenth Chapter, Arjuna knew perfectly well that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the fountainhead of everything and the last word in Transcendence. Of course, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also appeared as the son of Devak\u012b on this earth. How K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a remained the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal, original person, is very difficult for an ordinary man to understand. Therefore, to clarify this point, Arjuna put this question before K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a so that He Himself could speak authoritatively. That K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme authority is accepted by the whole world, not only at present, but from time immemorial, and the demons alone reject Him. Anyway, since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the authority accepted by all, Arjuna put this question before Him in order that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would describe Himself without being depicted by the demons who always try to distort Him in a way understandable to the demons and their followers. It is necessary that everyone, for his own interest, know the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself speaks about Himself, it is auspicious for all the worlds. To the demons, such explanations by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself may appear to be strange because the demons always study K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from their own standpoint, but those who are devotees heartily welcome the statements of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a when they are spoken by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. The devotees will always worship such authoritative statements of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because they are always eager to know more and more about Him. The atheists, who consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a an ordinary man, may in this way come to know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is superhuman, that He is sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha-the eternal form of bliss and knowledge-that He is transcendental, and that He is above the domination of the modes of material nature and above the influence of time and space. A devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s, like Arjuna, is undoubtedly above any misunderstanding of the transcendental position of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Arjuna\u2019s putting this question before the Lord is simply an attempt by the devotee to defy the atheistic attitude of persons who consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be an ordinary human being subject to the modes of material nature.\u00a0"

Such eternal, blissful, all-knowing forms of the Lord are usually understood by the best Vedic scholars, but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees.\u201d It is also stated in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101:\u00a0",

      "In the Vedas also it is said that the Lord, although one without a second, nevertheless manifests Himself in innumerable forms. He is like the vaidurya stone, which changes color yet still remains one. All those multi-forms are understood by the pure, unalloyed devotees, but not by a simple study of the Vedas: vede\u1e63u durllabham adurllabham \u0101tma-bhaktau. Devotees like Arjuna are constant companions of the Lord, and whenever the Lord incarnates, the associate devotees also incarnate in order to serve the Lord in different capacities. Arjuna is one of these devotees, and in this verse it is understood that some millions of years ago when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spoke the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to the sun-god Vivasv\u0101n, Arjuna, in a different capacity, was also present. But the difference between the Lord and Arjuna is that the Lord remembered the incidence, whereas Arjuna could not remember. That is the difference between the part and parcel living entity and the Supreme Lord. Although Arjuna is addressed herein as the mighty hero who could subdue the enemies, he is unable to recall what had happened in his various past births. Therefore, a living entity, however great he may be in the material estimation, can never equal the Supreme Lord. Anyone who is a constant companion of the Lord is certainly a liberated person, but he cannot be equal to the Lord. The Lord is described in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 as infallible (acyuta), which means that He never forgets Himself, even though He is in material contact. Therefore, the Lord and the living entity can never be equal in all respects, even if the living entity is as liberated as Arjuna. Although Arjuna is a devotee of the Lord, he sometimes forgets the nature of the Lord, but by the divine grace a devotee can at once understand the infallible condition of the Lord, whereas a nondevotee or a demon cannot understand this transcendental nature. Consequently these descriptions in the G\u012bt\u0101 cannot be understood by demonic brains. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a remembered acts which were performed by Him millions of years before, but Arjuna could not, despite the fact that both K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna are eternal in nature. We may also note herein that a living entity forgets everything due to his change of body, but the Lord remembers because He does not change His sac-cid-\u0101nanda body. He is advaita, which means there is no distinction between His body and Himself. Everything in relation to Him is spirit— whereas the conditioned soul is different from his material body. And, because the Lord\u2019s body and self are identical, His position is always different from the ordinary living entity, even when He descends to the material platform. The demons cannot adjust themselves to this transcendental nature of the Lord, as the Lord explains in the following verse.\u00a0"

      "The Lord has spoken about the peculiarity of His birth: although He may appear like an ordinary person, He remembers everything of His many, many past \u201cbirths,\u201d whereas a common man cannot remember what he has done even a few hours before. If someone is asked what he did exactly at the same time one day earlier, it would be very difficult for a common man to answer immediately. He would surely have to dredge his memory to recall what he was doing exactly at the same time one day before. And yet, men often dare claim to be God, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should not be misled by such meaningless claims. Then again, the Lord explains His prak\u1e5bti or His form. Prak\u1e5bti means nature as well as svar\u016bpa, or one\u2019s own form. The Lord says that He appears in His own body. He does not change His body, as the common living entity changes from one body to another. The conditioned soul may have one kind of body in the present birth, but he has a different body in the next birth. In the material world, the living entity has no fixed body but transmigrates from one body to another. The Lord, however, does not do so. Whenever He appears, He does so in the same original body, by His internal potency. In other words, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears in this material world in His original eternal form, with two hands, holding a flute. He appears exactly in His eternal body, uncontaminated by this material world. Although He appears in the same transcendental body and is Lord of the universe, it still appears that He takes His birth like an ordinary living entity. Despite the fact Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a grows from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth, astonishingly enough He never ages beyond youth. At the time of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, He had many grandchildren at home; or, in other words, He had sufficiently aged by material calculations. Still He looked just like a young man twenty or twenty-five years old. We never see a picture of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in old age because He never grows old like us, although He is the oldest person in the whole creation-past, present, and future. Neither His body nor His intelligence ever deteriorates or changes. Therefore, it is clear that in spite of His being in the material world, He is the same unborn, eternal form of bliss and knowledge, changeless in His transcendental body and intelligence. Factually, His appearance and disappearance are like the sun\u2019s rising, moving before us, and then disappearing from our eyesight. When the sun is out of sight, we think that the sun is set, and when the sun is before our eyes, we think that the sun is on the horizon. Actually, the sun is always in its fixed position, but owing to our defective, insufficient senses, we calculate the appearance and disappearance of the sun in the sky. And, because His appearance and disappearance are completely different from that of any ordinary, common living entity, it is evident that He is eternal, blissful knowledge by His internal potency-and He is never contaminated by material nature. The Vedas also confirm that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is unborn, yet He still appears to take His birth in multi-manifestations. The Vedic supplementary literatures also confirm that even though the Lord appears to be taking His birth, He is still without change of body. In the Bh\u0101gavatam, He appears before His mother as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, with four hands and the decorations of the six kinds of full opulences. His appearance in His original eternal form is His causeless mercy, according to the Vi\u015bvako\u015ba dictionary. The Lord is conscious of all of His previous appearances and disappearances, but a common living entity forgets everything about his past body as soon as he gets another body. He is the Lord of all living entities because He performs wonderful and superhuman activities while He is on this earth. Therefore, the Lord is always the same Absolute Truth and is without differentiation between His form and self, or between His quality and body. A question may now be raised as to why the Lord appears and disappears in this world. This is explained in the next verse.\u00a0"

      "The word s\u1e5bj\u0101mi is significant herein. S\u1e5bj\u0101mi cannot be used in the sense of creation. because, according to the previous verse, there is no creation of the Lord\u2019s form or body, since all of the forms are eternally existent. Therefore s\u1e5bj\u0101mi means that the Lord manifests Himself as He is. Although the Lord appears on schedule, namely at the end of Dv\u0101para-yuga of the twenty-eighth millennium of the eighth Manu, in one day of Brahm\u0101, still He has no obligation to adhere to such rules and regulations because He is completely free to act in many ways at His will. He therefore appears by His own will whenever there is a predominance of irreligiosity and a disappearance of true religion. Principles of religion are laid down in the Vedas, and any discrepancy in the matter of properly executing the rules of the Vedas makes one irreligious. In the Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that such principles are the laws of the Lord. Only the Lord can manufacture a system of religion. The Vedas are also accepted as originally spoken by the Lord Himself to Brahm\u0101, from within his heart. Therefore, the principles of dharma, or religion, are the direct orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (dharma\u1e41 tu s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101t-bhagavat-pra\u1e47\u012btam). These principles are clearly indicated throughout the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The purpose of the Vedas is to establish such principles under the order of the Supreme Lord, and the Lord directly orders, at the end of the G\u012bt\u0101, that the highest principle of religion is to surrender unto Him only, and nothing more. The Vedic principles push one towards complete surrender unto Him; and, whenever such principles are disturbed by the demonic, the Lord appears. From the Bh\u0101gavatam we understand that Lord Buddha is the incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who appeared when materialism was rampant and materialists were using the pretext of the authority of the Vedas. Although there are certain restrictive rules and regulations regarding animal sacrifice for particular purposes in the Vedas, people of demonic tendency still took to animal sacrifice without reference to the Vedic principles. Lord Buddha appeared to stop this nonsense and to establish the Vedic principles of nonviolence. Therefore each and every avat\u0101ra, or incarnation of the Lord, has a particular mission, and they are all described in the revealed scriptures. No one should be accepted as an avat\u0101ra unless he is referred to by scriptures. It is not a fact that the Lord appears only on Indian soil. He can advent Himself anywhere and everywhere, and whenever He desires to appear. In each and every incarnation, He speaks as much about religion as can be understood by the particular people under their particular circumstances. But the mission is the same— to lead people to God consciousness and obedience to the principles of religion. Sometimes He descends personally, and sometimes He sends His bona fide representative in the form of His son, or servant, or Himself in some disguised form.\u00a0",
      "The principles of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 were spoken to Arjuna, and, for that matter, to other highly elevated persons, because he was highly advanced compared to ordinary persons in other parts of the world. Two plus two equals four is a mathematical principle that is true both in the beginner\u2019s arithmetic class and in the advanced class as well. Still, there are higher and lower mathematics. In all incarnations of the Lord, therefore, the same principles are taught, but they appear to be higher and lower in varied circumstances. The higher principles of religion begin with the acceptance of the four orders and the four statuses of social life, as will be explained later. The whole purpose of the mission of incarnations is to arouse K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness everywhere. Such consciousness is manifest and nonmanifest only under different circumstances.\u00a0"

      "According to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, a s\u0101dhu (holyman) is a man in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A person may appear to be irreligious, but if he has the qualifications of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness wholly and fully, he is to be understood to be a s\u0101dhu. And du\u1e63k\u1e5btam applies to one who doesn\u2019t care for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Such miscreants, or du\u1e63k\u1e5btam, are described as foolish and the lowest of mankind, even though they may be decorated with mundane education; whereas another person, who is one hundred percent engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is accepted as s\u0101dhu, even though such a person may neither be learned nor well cultured. As far as the atheistic are concerned, it is not necessary for the Supreme Lord to appear as He is to destroy them, as He did with the demons R\u0101va\u1e47a and Ka\u1e41sa. The Lord has many agents who are quite competent to vanquish demons. But the Lord especially descends to appease His unalloyed devotees, who are always harassed by the demonic. The demon harasses the devotee, even though the latter may happen to be his kin. Although Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was the son of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, he was nonetheless persecuted by his father; although Devak\u012b, the mother of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, was the sister of Ka\u1e41sa, she and her husband Vasudeva were persecuted only because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was to be born of them. So Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared primarily to deliver Devak\u012b, rather than kill Ka\u1e41sa, but both were performed simultaneously. Therefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and vanquish the demon miscreants, the Lord appears in different incarnations.\u00a0",
      "In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ad\u0101sa Kavir\u0101ja, the following verses summarize these principles of incarnation:\u00a0",
      "sṛṣṭi-hetu yei mūrti prapañce avatare \n sei īśvara-mūrti ‘avatāra’ nāma dhare \n māyātita paravyome savāra avasthāna \n viśve ‘avatāri’ dhare ‘avatāra’ nāma.",
      "\u201cThe avat\u0101ra, or incarnation of Godhead, descends from the kingdom of God for material manifestation. And the particular form of the Personality of Godhead who so descends is called an incarnation, or avat\u0101ra. Such incarnations are situated in the spiritual world, the kingdom of God. When they descend to the material creation, they assume the name avat\u0101ra.\u201d\u00a0",
      "There are various kinds of avat\u0101ras, such as puru\u1e63\u0101vat\u0101ras, gu\u1e47\u0101vat\u0101ras, l\u012bl\u0101vat\u0101ras, \u015bakty\u0101ve\u015ba avat\u0101ras, manvantara-avat\u0101ras and yug\u0101vat\u0101ras— all appearing on schedule all over the universe.

      "The Lord\u2019s descent from His transcendental abode is already explained in the 6th verse. One who can understand the truth of the appearance of the Personality of Godhead is already liberated from material bondage, and therefore he returns to the kingdom of God immediately after quitting this present material body. Such liberation of the living entity from material bondage is not at all easy. The impersonalists and the yog\u012bs attain liberation only after much trouble and many, many births. Even then, the liberation they achieve-merging into the impersonal brahmajyoti of the Lord-is only partial, and there is the risk of returning again to this material world. But the devotee, simply by understanding the transcendental nature of the body and activities of the Lord, attains the abode of the Lord after ending this body and does not run the risk of returning again to this material world. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is stated that the Lord has many, many forms and incarnations: advaitam acyutam an\u0101dim ananta-r\u016bpam. Although there are many transcendental forms of the Lord, they are still one and the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. One has to understand this fact with conviction, although it is incomprehensible to mundane scholars and empiric philosophers. As stated in the Vedas:\u00a0",
      "eko devo nitya-līlānurakto bhakta-vyāpī hṛdy antarātmā.",
      "\u201cThe one Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally engaged in many, many transcendental forms in relationships with His unalloyed devotees.\u201d This Vedic version is confirmed in this verse of the G\u012bt\u0101 personally by the Lord. He who accepts this truth on the strength of the authority of the Vedas and of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and who does not waste time in philosophical speculations attains the highest perfectional stage of liberation. Simply by accepting this truth on faith, one can, without a doubt, attain liberation. The Vedic version, \u201ctattvamasi,\u201d is actually applied in this case. Anyone who understands Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be the Supreme, or who says unto the Lord, \u201cYou are the same Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead\u201d is certainly liberated instantly, and consequently his entrance into the transcendental association of the Lord is guaranteed. In other words, such a faithful devotee of the Lord attains perfection, and this is confirmed by the following Vedic assertion:\u00a0",
      "tam eva viditvātimṛtyumeti nānyaḥ panthā vidyate ayanāya.",
      "One can attain the perfect stage of liberation from birth and death simply by knowing the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is no alternative because anyone who does not understand Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is surely in the mode of ignorance. Consequently he will not attain salvation, simply, so to speak, by licking the outer surface of the bottle of honey, or by interpreting the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 according to mundane scholarship. Such empiric philosophers may assume very important roles in the material world, but they are not necessarily eligible for liberation. Such puffed up mundane scholars have to wait for the causeless mercy of the devotee of the Lord. One should therefore cultivate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness with faith and knowledge, and in this way attain perfection.\u00a0"

      "As described above, it is very difficult for a person who is too materially affected to understand the personal nature of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Generally, people who are attached to the bodily conception of life are so absorbed in materialism that it is almost impossible for them to understand that there is a transcendental body which is imperishable, full of knowledge and eternally blissful. In the materialistic concept, the body is perishable, full of ignorance and completely miserable. Therefore, people in general keep this same bodily idea in mind when they are informed of the personal form of the Lord. For such materialistic men, the form of the gigantic material manifestation is supreme. Consequently they consider the Supreme to be impersonal. And because they are too materially absorbed, the conception of retaining the personality after liberation from matter frightens them. When they are informed that spiritual life is also individual and personal, they become afraid of becoming persons again, and so they naturally prefer a kind of merging into the impersonal void. Generally, they compare the living entities to the bubbles of the ocean, which merge into the ocean. That is the highest perfection of spiritual existence attainable without individual personality. This is a kind of fearful stage of life, devoid of perfect knowledge of spiritual existence. Furthermore there are many persons who cannot understand spiritual existence at all. Being embarassed by so many theories and by contradictions of various types of philosophical speculation, they become disgusted or angry and foolishly conclude that there is no supreme cause and that everything is ultimately void. Such people are in a diseased condition of life. Some people are too materially attached and therefore do not give attention to spiritual life, some of them want to merge into the supreme spiritual cause, and some of them disbelieve in everything, being angry at all sorts of spiritual speculation out of hopelessness. This last class of men take to the shelter of some kind of intoxication, and their affective hallucinations are sometimes accepted as spiritual vision. One has to get rid of all three stages of attachment to the material world: negligence of spiritual life, fear of a spiritual personal identity, and the conception of void that underlies the frustration of life. To get free from these three stages of the material concept of life, one has to take complete shelter of the Lord, guided by the bona fide spiritual master, and follow the disciplines and regulative principles of devotional life. The last stage of the devotional life is called bh\u0101va, or transcendental love of Godhead.\u00a0",
      "According to Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu, the science of devotional service:\u00a0",
      "ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgo ‘tha bhajana-kriyā \n tato ‘nartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt tato niṣṭhā rucis tataḥ \n athāsaktis tato bhāvas tataḥ premābhyudañcati \n sādhakānām ayaṁ premṇaḥ prādurbhāve bhavet kramaḥ.",
      "\u201cIn the beginning one must have a preliminary desire for self-realization. This will bring one to the stage of trying to associate with persons who are spiritually elevated. In next stage one becomes initiated by an elevated spiritual master, and under his instruction the neophyte devotee begins the process of devotional service. By execution of devotional service under the guidance of the spiritual master, one becomes free from all material attachment, attains steadiness in self-realization, and acquires a taste for hearing about the Absolute Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This taste leads one further forward to attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which is matured in bh\u0101va, or the preliminary stage of transcendental love of God. Real love for God is called prem\u0101, the highest perfectional stage of life.\u201d In the prem\u0101 stage there is constant engagement in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. So, by the slow process of devotional service, under the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master, one can attain the highest stage, being freed from all material attachment, from the fearfulness of one\u2019s individual spiritual personality, and from the frustrations resulting from void philosophy. Then one can ultimately attain to the abode of the Supreme Lord.\u00a0"

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is partially realized in His impersonal brahmajyoti effulgence and as the all-pervading Supersoul dwelling within everything, including the particles of atoms. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is only fully realized by His pure devotees. Consequently, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the object of everyone\u2019s realization, and thus anyone and everyone is satisfied according to one\u2019s desire to have Him. In the transcendental world also, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a reciprocates with His pure devotees in the transcendental attitude, just as the devotee wants Him. One devotee may want K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as supreme master, another as his personal friend, another as his son, and still another as his lover. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a rewards all the devotees equally, according to their different intensities of love for Him. In the material world, the same reciprocations of feelings are there, and they are equally exchanged by the Lord with the different types of worshipers. The pure devotees both here and in the transcendental abode associate with Him in person and are able to render personal service to the Lord and thus derive transcendental bliss in His loving service. As for those who are impersonalists and who want to commit spiritual suicide by annihilating the individual existence of the living entity, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a helps also by absorbing them into His effulgence. Such impersonalists do not agree to accept the eternal, blissful Personality of Godhead; consequently they cannot relish the bliss of transcendental personal service to the Lord, having extinguished their individuality. Some of them, who are not situated even in the impersonal existence, return to this material field to exhibit their dormant desires for activities. They are not admitted in the spiritual planets, but they are again given a chance to act on the material planets. For those who are fruitive workers, the Lord awards the desired results of their prescribed duties, as the yaj\u00f1e\u015bvara; and those who are yog\u012bs seeking mystic powers are awarded such powers. In other words, everyone is dependant for success upon His mercy alone, and all kinds of spiritual processes are but different degrees of success on the same path. Unless, therefore, one comes to the highest perfection of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, all attempts remain imperfect, as is stated in the \u015ar\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam:\u00a0",

      "There is a great misconception about the gods or demigods of this material world, and men of less intelligence, although passing as great scholars, take these demigods to be various forms of the Supreme Lord. Actually, the demigods are not different forms of God, but they are God\u2019s different parts and parcels. God is one, and the parts and parcels are many. The Vedas say, nityo nity\u0101n\u0101m: God is one. \u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25. The Supreme God is one— K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a— and the demigods are delegated with powers to manage this material world. These demigods are all living entities (nity\u0101n\u0101m) with different grades of material power. They cannot be equal to the Supreme God— N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Anyone who thinks that God and the demigods are on the same level is called an atheist, or p\u0101\u1e63a\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b. Even the great demigods like Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva cannot be compared to the Supreme Lord. In fact, the Lord is worshiped by demigods such as Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva (\u015biva-viri\u00f1ci-nutam). Yet curiously enough there are many human leaders who are worshiped by foolish men under the misunderstanding of anthropomorphism or zoomorphism. Iha devat\u0101\u1e25 denotes a powerful man or demigod of this material world. But N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, does not belong to this world. He is above, or transcendental to, material creation. Even \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, the leader of the impersonalists, maintains that N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is beyond this material creation. However, foolish people (h\u1e5bt-a\u00f1jana) worship the demigods because they want immediate results. They get the results, but do not know that results so obtained are temporary and are meant for less intelligent persons. The intelligent person is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and he has no need to worship the paltry demigods for some immediate, temporary benefit. The demigods of this material world, as well as their worshipers, will vanish with the annihilation of this material world. The boons of the demigods are material and temporary. Both the material worlds and their inhabitants, including the demigods, and their worshipers, are bubbles in the cosmic ocean. In this world, however, human society is mad after temporary things such as the material opulence of possessing land, family and enjoyable paraphernalia. To achieve such temporary things, they worship the demigods or powerful men in human society. If a man gets some ministership in the government by worshiping a political leader, he considers that he has achieved a great boon. All of them are therefore kowtowing to the so-called leaders or \u201cbig guns\u201d in order to achieve temporary boons, and they indeed achieve such things. Such foolish men are not interested in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness for the permanent solution to the hardships of material existence. They are all after sense enjoyment, and to get a little facility for sense enjoyment they are attracted to worship empowered living entities known as demigods. This verse indicates that people are rarely interested in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. They are mostly interested in material enjoyment, and therefore they worship some powerful living entity.\u00a0"

      "The Lord is the creator of everything. Everything is born of Him, everything is sustained by Him, and everything, after annihilation, rests in Him. He is therefore the creator of the four divisions of the social order, beginning with the intelligent class of men, technically called br\u0101hma\u1e47as due to their being situated in the mode of goodness. Next is the administrative class, technically called the k\u1e63atriyas due to their being situated in the mode of passion. The mercantile men, called the vai\u015byas, are situated in the mixed modes of passion and ignorance, and the \u015b\u016bdras, or laborer class, are situated in the ignorant mode of material nature. In spite of His creating the four divisions of human society, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not belong to any of these divisions, because He is not one of the conditioned souls, a section of whom form human society. Human society is similar to any other animal society, but to elevate men from the animal status, the abovementioned divisions are created by the Lord for the systematic development of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The tendency of a particular man toward work is determined by the modes of material nature which he has acquired. Such symptoms of life, according to different modes of material nature, are described in the Eighteenth Chapter of this book. A person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, is above even the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, because a br\u0101hma\u1e47a by quality is supposed to know about Brahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth. Most of them approach the impersonal Brahman manifestation of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but only a man who transcends the limited knowledge of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a and reaches the knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, becomes a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness-or, in other words, a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness includes knowledge of all different plenary expansions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, namely R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, Var\u0101ha, etc. However, as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transcendental to this system of the four divisions of human society, a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is also transcendental to all divisions of human society, whether we consider the divisions of community, nation or species.\u00a0"

      "As there are constitutional laws in the material world stating that the king can do no wrong, or that the king is not subject to the state laws, similarly the Lord, although He is the creator of this material world, is not affected by the activities of the material world. He creates and remains aloof from the creation, whereas the living entities are entangled in the fruitive results of material activities because of their propensity for lording it over material resources. The proprietor of an establishment is not responsible for the right and wrong activities of the workers, but the workers are themselves responsible. The living entities are engaged in their respective activities of sense gratification, and these activities are not ordained by the Lord. For advancement of sense gratification, the living entities are engaged in the work of this world, and they aspire to heavenly happiness after death. The Lord, being full in Himself, has no attraction for so-called heavenly happiness. The heavenly demigods are only His engaged servants. The proprietor never desires the low-grade happiness such as the workers may desire. He is aloof from the material actions and reactions. For example, the rains are not responsible for different types of vegetation that appear on the earth, although without such rains there is no possibility of vegetative growth. Vedic sm\u1e5bti confirms this fact as follows:\u00a0",
      "nimitta-mātram evāsau sṛjyānāṁ sarga-karmaṇi \n pradhāna-kāraṇī-bhūtā yato vai sṛjya-śaktayaḥ.",
      "In the material creations, the Lord is only the supreme cause. The immediate cause is material nature by which the cosmic manifestation is visible. The created beings are of many varieties, such as the demigods, human beings and lower animals, and all of them are subject to the reactions of their past good or bad activities. The Lord only gives them the proper facilities for such activities and the regulations of the modes of nature, but He is never responsible for their past and present activities. In the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras it is confirmed that the Lord is never partial to any living entity. The living entity is responsible for his own acts. The Lord only gives him facilities, through the agency of material nature, the external energy. Anyone who is fully conversant with all the intricacies of this law of karma, or fruitive activities, does not become affected by the results of his activities. In other words, the person who understands this transcendental nature of the Lord is an experienced man in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and thus he is never subjected to the laws of karma. One who does not know the transcendental nature of the Lord and who thinks that the activities of the Lord are aimed at fruitive results, as are the activities of the ordinary living entities, certainly becomes entangled himself in fruitive reaction. But one who knows the Supreme Truth is a liberated soul fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u00a0"

One must follow in the footsteps of great authorities like Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva, N\u0101rada, Manu, Kum\u0101ra, Kapila, Prahl\u0101da, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, Yamar\u0101ja, Janaka, etc. By mental speculation one cannot ascertain what is religion or self-realization. Therefore, out of causeless mercy to His devotees, the Lord explains directly to Arjuna what action is and what inaction is. Only action performed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness can deliver a person from the entanglement of material existence.\u00a0"

    "If one is serious about liberation from material bondage, one has to understand the distinctions between action, inaction and unauthorized actions. One has to apply oneself to such an analysis of action, reaction and perverted actions because it is a very difficult subject matter. To understand Kṛṣṇa consciousness and action according to the modes, one has to learn one’s relationship with the Supreme; i.e., one who has learned perfectly knows that every living entity is the eternal servitor of the Lord and that consequently one has to act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The entire Bhagavad-gītā is directed toward this conclusion. Any other conclusions, against this consciousness and its attendant reactions, are vikarmas, or prohibitive actions. To understand all this one has to associate with authorities in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and learn the secret from them; this is as good as learning from the Lord directly.

      "How activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness can lead one ultimately to the spiritual goal is described here. There are various activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and all of them will be described in the following verses. But, for the present, just the principle of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is described. A conditioned soul, entangled in material contamination, is sure to act in the material atmosphere, and yet he has to get out of such an environment. The process by which the conditioned soul can get out of the material atmosphere is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. For example, a patient who is suffering from a disorder of the bowels due to overindulgence in milk products is cured by another milk product, namely curds. The materially absorbed conditioned soul can be cured by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness as set forth here in the G\u012bt\u0101. This process is generally known as yaj\u00f1a, or activities (sacrifices) simply meant for the satisfaction of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The more the activities of the material world are performed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u only, the more the atmosphere becomes spiritualized by complete absorption. Brahman means spiritual. The Lord is spiritual, and the rays of His transcendental body are called brahmajyoti, His spiritual effulgence. Everything that exists is situated in that brahmajyoti, but when the jyoti is covered by illusion (m\u0101y\u0101) or sense gratification, it is called material. This material veil can be removed at once by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; thus the offering for the sake of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the consuming agent of such an offering or contribution; the process of consumption, the contributor, and the result are— all combined together— Brahman, or the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth covered by m\u0101y\u0101 is called matter. Matter dovetailed for the cause of the Absolute Truth regains its spiritual quality. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the process of converting the illusory consciousness into Brahman, or the Supreme. When the mind is fully absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, it is said to be in sam\u0101dhi, or trance. Anything done in such transcendental consciousness is called yaj\u00f1a, or sacrifice for the Absolute. In that condition of spiritual consciousness, the contributor, the contribution, the consumption, the performer or leader of the performance, and the result or ultimate gain— everything— becomes one in the Absolute, the Supreme Brahman. That is the method of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u00a0"

      "As described above, a person engaged in discharging duties in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is also called a perfect yog\u012b or a first-class mystic. But there are others also, who perform similar sacrifices in the worship of demigods, and still others who sacrifice to the Supreme Brahman, or the impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord. So there are different kinds of sacrifices in terms of different categories. Such different categories of sacrifice by different types of performers only superficially demark varieties of sacrifice. Factual sacrifice means to satisfy the Supreme Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is also known as Yaj\u00f1a. All the different varieties of sacrifice can be placed within two primary divisions: namely, sacrifice of worldly possessions and sacrifice in pursuit of transcendental knowledge. Those who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness sacrifice all material possessions for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, while others, who want some temporary material happiness, sacrifice their material possessions to satisfy demigods such as Indra, the sun-god, etc. And others, who are impersonalists, sacrifice their identity by merging into the existence of impersonal Brahman. The demigods are powerful living entities appointed by the Supreme Lord for the maintenance and supervision of all material functions like the heating, watering and lighting of the universe. Those who are interested in material benefits worship the demigods by various sacrifices according to the Vedic rituals. They are called bahv-\u012b\u015bvara-v\u0101d\u012b, or believers in many gods. But others, who worship the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth and regard the forms of the demigods as temporary, sacrifice their individual selves in the supreme fire and thus end their individual existences by merging into the existence of the Supreme. Such impersonalists spend their time in philosophical speculation to understand the transcendental nature of the Supreme. In other words, the fruitive workers sacrifice their material possessions for material enjoyment, whereas the impersonalist sacrifices his material designations with a view to merging into the existence of the Supreme. For the impersonalist, the fire altar of sacrifice is the Supreme Brahman, and the offering is the self being consumed by the fire of Brahman. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, like Arjuna, however, sacrifices everything for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus all his material possessions as well as his own self-everything-is sacrificed for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus, he is the first-class yog\u012b; but he does not lose his individual existence.\u00a0"

Since human life is not meant for our enjoying sense gratification like the animals, the four orders of human life are so arranged that one may become perfect in spiritual life. The brahmac\u0101r\u012bs, or students under the care of a bona fide spiritual master, control the mind by abstaining from sense gratification. They are referred to in this verse as sacrificing the hearing process and the senses in the fire of the controlled mind. A brahmac\u0101r\u012b hears only words concerning K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; hearing is the basic principle for understanding, and therefore the pure brahmac\u0101r\u012b engages fully in harer n\u0101m\u0101nuk\u012brtanam-chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord. He restrains himself from the vibrations of material sounds, and his hearing is engaged in the transcendental sound vibration of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Similarly, the householders, who have some license for sense gratification, perform such acts with great restraint. Sex life, intoxication and meat eating are general tendencies of human society, but a regulated householder does not indulge in unrestricted sex life and other sense gratifications. Marriage on principles of religious life is therefore current in all civilized human society because that is the way for restricted sex life. This restricted, unattached sex life is also a kind of yaj\u00f1a because the restricted householder sacrifices his general tendency toward sense gratification for higher transcendental life.\u00a0"

The senses interact with the sense objects, like the ear for hearing, eyes for seeing, nose for smelling, tongue for tasting, hand for touching, and all of them are thus engaged in activities outside the self.

All these charitable activities are called dravyamaya-yaj\u00f1a. There are others who, for higher elevation in life or for promotion to higher planets within the universe, voluntarily accept many kinds of austerities such as candr\u0101yana and c\u0101turm\u0101sya. These processes entail severe vows for conducting life under certain rigid rules. For example, under the c\u0101turm\u0101sya vow the candidate does not shave for four months during the year (July to October), he does not eat certain foods, does not eat twice in a day and does not leave home. Such sacrifice of the comforts of life is called tapomaya-yaj\u00f1a. There are still others who engage themselves in different kinds of mystic yogas like the Pata\u00f1jali system (for merging into the existence of the Absolute), or ha\u1e6dha-yoga or a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga (for particular perfections). And some travel to all the sanctified places of pilgrimage. All these practices are called yoga-yaj\u00f1a, sacrifice for a certain type of perfection in the material world. There are others who engage themselves in the studies of different Vedic literatures, specifically the Upani\u1e63ads and Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras, or the s\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy. All of these are called sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya-yaj\u00f1a, or engagement in the sacrifice of studies.

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness cannot be attained by any one of the above-mentioned types of sacrifices but can be attained only by the mercy of the Lord and His bona fide devotee.

      "This system of yoga for controlling the breathing process is called pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, and in the beginning it is practiced in the ha\u1e6dha-yoga system through different sitting postures. All of these processes are recommended for controlling the senses and for advancement in spiritual realization. This practice involves controlling the air within the body to enable simultaneous passage in opposite directions. The ap\u0101na air goes downward, and the pr\u0101\u1e47a air goes up. The pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma yog\u012b practices breathing the opposite way until the currents are neutralized into p\u016braka, equilibrium. Similarly, when the exhaled breathing is offered to inhaled breathing, it is called recaka. When both air currents are completely stopped, it is called kumbhaka-yoga. By practice of kumbhaka-yoga, the yog\u012bs increase the duration of life by many, many years. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, however, being always situated in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, automatically becomes the controller of the senses. His senses, being always engaged in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, have no chance of becoming otherwise engaged. So at the end of life, he is naturally transferred to the transcendental plane of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; consequently he makes no attempt to increase his longevity. He is at once raised to the platform of liberation. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person begins from the transcendental stage, and he is constantly in that consciousness. Therefore, there is no falling down, and ultimately he enters into the abode of the Lord without delay. The practice of reduced eating is automatically done when one eats only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a pras\u0101dam, or food which is offered first to the Lord. Reducing the eating process is very helpful in the matter of sense control. And without sense control there is no possibility of getting out of the material entanglement.\u00a0"

      "From the foregoing explanation of differents types of sacrifice (namely sacrifice of one\u2019s possessions, study of the Vedas or philosophical doctrines, and performance of the yoga system), it is found that the common aim of all is to control the senses. Sense gratification is the root cause of material existence; therefore, unless and until one is situated on a platform apart from sense gratification, there is no chance of being elevated to the eternal platform of full knowledge, full bliss and full life. This platform is in the eternal atmosphere, or Brahman atmosphere. All the above-mentioned sacrifices help one to become cleansed of the sinful reactions of material existence. By this advancement in life, one not only becomes happy and opulent in this life, but also, at the end, he enters into the eternal kingdom of God, either merging into the impersonal Brahman or associating with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u00a0"

      "Whatever form of material existence one is in, one is invariably ignorant of his real situation. In other words, existence in the material world is due to the multiple reactions to our sinful lives. Ignorance is the cause of sinful life, and sinful life is the cause of one\u2019s dragging on in material existence. The human form of life is the only loophole by which one may get out of this entanglement. The Vedas, therefore, give us a chance for escape by pointing out the paths of religion, economic comfort, regulated sense gratification and, at last, the means to get out of the miserable condition entirely. The path of religion, or the different kinds of sacrifice recommended above, automatically solves our economic problems. By performance of yaj\u00f1a we can have enough food, enough milk, etc.-even if there is a so-called increase of population. When the body is fully supplied, naturally the next stage is to satisfy the senses. The Vedas prescribe, therefore, sacred marriage for regulated sense gratification. Thereby one is gradually elevated to the platform of release from material bondage, and the highest perfection of liberated life is to associate with the Supreme Lord. Perfection is achieved by performance of yaj\u00f1a (sacrifice), as described above. Now, if a person is not inclined to perform yaj\u00f1a according to the Vedas, how can he expect a happy life? There are different grades of material comforts in different heavenly planets, and in all cases there is immense happiness for persons engaged in different kinds of yaj\u00f1a. But the highest kind of happiness that a man can achieve is to be promoted to the spiritual planets by practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A life of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is therefore the solution to all the problems of material existence.\u00a0"

The Lord is the original spiritual master, and a person in the disciplic succession can convey the message of the Lord as it is to his disciple.

Therefore, mental speculation or dry arguments cannot help one progress in spiritual life. One has to approach a bona fide spiritual master to receive the knowledge. Such a spiritual master should be accepted in full surrender, and one should serve the spiritual master like a menial servant, without false prestige. Satisfaction of the self-realized spiritual master is the secret of advancement in spiritual life. Inquiries and submission constitute the proper combination for spiritual understanding. Unless there is submission and service, inquiries from the learned spiritual master will not be effective. One must be able to pass the test of the spiritual master, and when he sees the genuine desire of the disciple, he automatically blesses the disciple with genuine spiritual understanding. In this verse, both blind following and absurd inquiries are condemned. One should not only hear submissively from the spiritual master; but one must also get a clear understanding from him, in submission and service and inquiries. A bona fide spiritual master is by nature very kind toward the disciple. Therefore when the student is submissive and is always ready to render service, the reciprocation of knowledge and inquiries becomes perfect.\u00a0"

      "The result of receiving knowledge from a self-realized soul, or one who knows things as they are, is learning that all living beings are parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The sense of a separated existence from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called m\u0101y\u0101 (m\u0101-not, y\u0101-this). Some think that we have nothing to do with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is only a great historical personality and that the Absolute is the impersonal Brahman. Factually, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, this impersonal Brahman is the personal effulgence of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the cause of everything. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is clearly stated that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes. Even the millions of incarnations are only His different expansions. Similarly, the living entities are also expansions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers wrongly think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a loses His own separate existence in His many expansions. This thought is material in nature. We have experience in the material world that a thing, when fragmentally distributed, loses its own original identity. But the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers fail to understand that Absolute means that one plus one is equal to one, and that one minus one is also equal to one. This is the case in the absolute world.\u00a0",
      "For want of sufficient knowledge in the absolute science, we are now covered with illusion, and therefore we think that we are separate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Although we are separated parts of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we are nevertheless not different from Him. The bodily difference of the living entities is m\u0101y\u0101, or not actual fact. We are all meant to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By m\u0101y\u0101 alone Arjuna thought that the temporary bodily relationship with his kinsmen was more important than his eternal spiritual relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The whole teaching of the G\u012bt\u0101 is targetted toward this end: that a living being, as His eternal servitor, cannot be separated from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and his sense of being an identity apart from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called m\u0101y\u0101. The living entities, as separate parts and parcels of the Supreme, have a purpose to fulfill. Having forgotten that purpose, since time immemorial they are situated in different bodies, as men, animals, demigods, etc. Such bodily differences arise from forgetfulness of the transcendental service of the Lord. But when one is engaged in transcendental service through K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one becomes at once liberated from this illusion. One can acquire such pure knowledge only from the bona fide spiritual master and thereby avoid the delusion that the living entity is equal to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Perfect knowledge is that the Supreme Soul, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the supreme shelter for all living entities, and giving up such shelter, the living entities are deluded by the material energy, imagining themselves to have a separate identity. Thus, under different standards of material identity, they become forgetful of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When, however, such deluded living entities become situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, it is to be understood that they are on the path of liberation, as confirmed in the Bh\u0101gavatam: muktir hitv\u0101nyath\u0101 r\u016bpa\u1e41 svar\u016bpe\u1e47a vyavasthiti\u1e25. Liberation means to be situated in one\u2019s constitutional position as the eternal servitor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness).\u00a0"

      "The yoga system instructed in this chapter is called san\u0101tana-yoga, or eternal activities performed by the living entity. This yoga has two divisions of sacrificial actions: one is called sacrifice of one\u2019s material possessions, and the other is called knowledge of self, which is pure spiritual activity. If sacrifice of one\u2019s material possessions is not dovetailed for spiritual realization, then such sacrifice becomes material. But one who performs such sacrifices with a spiritual objective, or in devotional service, makes a perfect sacrifice. When we come to spiritual activities, we find that these are also divided into two: namely, understanding of one\u2019s own self (or one\u2019s constitutional position), and the truth regarding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who follows the path of the G\u012bt\u0101 as it is can very easily understand these two important divisions of spiritual knowledge. For him there is no difficulty in obtaining perfect knowledge of the self as part and parcel of the Lord. And such understanding is beneficial for such a person who easily understands the transcendental activities of the Lord. In the beginning of this chapter, the transcendental activities of the Lord were discussed by the Supreme Lord Himself. One who does not understand the instructions of the G\u012bt\u0101 is faithless, and is to be considered to be misusing the fragmental independence awarded to him by the Lord. In spite of such instructions, one who does not understand the real nature of the Lord as the eternal, blissful, all-knowing Personality of Godhead, is certainly fool number one. Ignorance can be removed by gradual acceptance of the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is awakened by different types of sacrifices to the demigods, sacrifice to Brahman, sacrifice in celibacy, in household life, in controlling the senses, in practicing mystic yoga, in penance, in foregoing material possessions, in studying the Vedas, and in partaking of the social institution called var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma. All of these are known as sacrifice, and all of them are based on regulated action. But within all these activities, the important factor is self-realization. One who seeks that objective is the real student of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, but one who doubts the authority of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a falls back. One is therefore advised to study Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, or any other scripture, under a bona fide spiritual master, with service and surrender. A bona fide spiritual master is in the disciplic succession from time eternal, and he does not deviate at all from the instructions of the Supreme Lord as they were imparted millions of years ago to the sun-god, from whom the instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 have come down to the earthly kingdom. One should, therefore, follow the path of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it is expressed in the G\u012bt\u0101 itself and beware of self-interested people after personal aggrandizement who deviate others from the actual path. The Lord is definitely the supreme person, and His activities are transcendental. One who understands this is a liberated person from the very beginning of his study of the G\u012bt\u0101.\u00a0",
      "Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fourth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of Transcendental Knowledge.\u00a0"

      "In this Fifth Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord says that work in devotional service is better than dry mental speculation. Devotional service is easier than the latter because, being transcendental in nature, it frees one from reaction. In the Second Chapter, preliminary knowledge of the soul and its entanglement in the material body were explained. How to get out of this material encagement by buddhi-yoga, or devotional service, was also explained therein. In the Third Chapter, it was explained that a person who is situated on the platform of knowledge no longer has any duties to perform. And, in the Fourth Chapter, the Lord told Arjuna that all kinds of sacrificial work culminate in knowledge. However, at the end of the Fourth Chapter, the Lord advised Arjuna to wake up and fight, being situated in perfect knowledge. Therefore, by simultaneously stressing the importance of both work in devotion and inaction in knowledge, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has perplexed Arjuna and confused his determination. Arjuna understands that renunciation in knowledge involves cessation of all kinds of work performed as sense activities. But if one performs work in devotional service, then how is work stopped? In other words, he thinks that sanny\u0101sam, or renunciation in knowledge, should be altogether free from all kinds of activity because work and renunciation appear to him to be incompatible. He appears not to have understood that work in full knowledge is nonreactive and is therefore the same as inaction. He inquires, therefore, whether he should cease work altogether, or work with full knowledge.\u00a0"

      "Fruitive activities (seeking sense gratification) are cause for material bondage. As long as one is engaged in activities aimed at improving the standard of bodily comfort, one is sure to transmigrate to different types of bodies, thereby continuing material bondage perpetually. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam confirms this as follows:\u00a0",
      "nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma yad indriya-prītaya āpṛṇoti \n na sādhu manye yata ātmano ‘yam asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ",

      "evaṁ manaḥ karma-vaśaṁ prayuṅkte avidyayātmany upadhīyamāne \nprītir na yāvan mayi vāsudeve na mucyate deha-yogena tāvat",
      "\u201cPeople are mad after sense gratification, and they do not know that this present body, which is full of miseries, is a result of one\u2019s fruitive activities in the past. Although this body is temporary, it is always giving one trouble in many ways. Therefore, to act for sense gratification is not good. One is considered to be a failure in life as long as he makes no inquiry about the nature of work for fruitive results, for as long as one is engrossed in the consciousness of sense gratification, one has to transmigrate from one body to another. Although the mind may be engrossed in fruitive activities and influenced by ignorance, one must develop a love for devotional service to V\u0101sudeva. Only then can one have the opportunity to get out of the bondage of material existence.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 5.5.4-6)When a person considers sense gratification the aim of life, he certainly becomes mad after materialistic living and engages in all kinds of sinful activity. He does not know that due to his past misdeeds he has already received a body which, although temporary, is the cause of his misery. Actually the living entity should not have taken on a material body, but he has been awarded the material body for sense gratification. Therefore I think it not befitting an intelligent man to involve himself again in the activities of sense gratification by which he perpetually gets material bodies one after another.\u00a0",
      "Therefore, j\u00f1\u0101na (or knowledge that one is not this material body but spirit soul) is not sufficient for liberation. One has to act in the status of spirit soul, otherwise there is no escape from material bondage. Action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is not, however, action on the fruitive platform. Activities performed in full knowledge strengthen one\u2019s advancement in real knowledge. Without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, mere renunciation of fruitive activities does not actually purify the heart of a conditioned soul. As long as the heart is not purified, one has to work on the fruitive platform. But action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness automatically helps one escape the result of fruitive action so that one need not descend to the material platform. Therefore, action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is always superior to renunciation, which always entails a risk of falling. Renunciation without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is incomplete, as is confirmed by \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu.\u00a0",
      "\u201cRenunciation by persons eager to achieve liberation of things which are related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, though they are material, is called incomplete renunciation.\u201d Renunciation is compete when it is in the knowledge that everything in existence belongs to the Lord and that no one should claim proprietorship over anything. One should understand that, factually, nothing belongs to anyone. Then where is the question of renunciation? One who knows that everything is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s property is always situated in renunciation. Since everything belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, everything should be employed in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This perfect form of action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is far better than any amount of artificial renunciation by a sanny\u0101s\u012b of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b school.\u00a0"

      "The real purpose of philosophical research is to find the ultimate goal of life. Since the ultimate goal of life is self-realization, there is no difference between the conclusions reached by the two processes. By s\u0101\u1e45khya philosophical research one comes to the conclusion that a living entity is not a part and parcel of the material world, but of the supreme spirit whole. Consequently, the spirit soul has nothing to do with the material world; his actions must be in some relation with the Supreme. When he acts in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he is actually in his constitutional position. In the first process of s\u0101\u1e45khya, one has to become detached from matter, and in the devotional yoga process one has to attach himself to the work of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Factually, both processes are the same, although superficially one process appears to involve detachment and the other process appears to involve attachment. However, detachment from matter and attachment to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are one and the same. One who can see this sees things as they are.\u00a0"

The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs also study the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras, but use their own commentary, called \u015a\u0101r\u012braka-bh\u0101\u1e63ya, written by \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya.

The Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012bs have nothing to do with material activities, and yet they perform various activities in their devotional service to the Lord. But the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs, engaged in the studies of s\u0101\u1e45khya and Ved\u0101nta and speculation, cannot relish transcendental service of the Lord. Because their studies become very tedious, they sometimes become tired of Brahman speculation, and thus they take shelter of the Bh\u0101gavatam without proper understanding. Consequently their study of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam becomes troublesome. Dry speculations and impersonal interpretations by artificial means are all useless for the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012bs, who are engaged in devotional service, are happy in the discharge of their transcendental duties, and they have the guarantee of ultimate entrance into the kingdom of God. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs sometimes fall down from the path of self-realization and again enter into material activities of a philanthropic and altruistic nature, which are nothing but material engagements. Therefore, the conclusion is that those who are engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are better situated than the sanny\u0101s\u012bs engaged in simple Brahman speculation, although they too come to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, after many births.\u00a0"

Such a person cannot think of any living being as separate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, just as the leaves and branches of a tree are not separate from the tree.

Because one who works in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is servant to all, he is very dear to everyone. And, because everyone is satisfied by his work, he is pure in consciousness. Because he is pure in consciousness, his mind is completely controlled. And, because his mind is controlled, his senses are also controlled. Because his mind is always fixed on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, there is no chance of his being deviated from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

Wasn\u2019t he in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness?\u201d Arjuna was only superficially offensive because (as has already been explained in the Second Chapter) all the assembled persons on the battlefield would continue to live individually, as the soul cannot be slain. So, spiritually, no one was killed on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra. Only their dresses were changed by the order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who was personally present.

The temporary body or material dwelling place which he obtains is the cause of varieties of activities and their resultant reactions.

It is ignorance acquired from time immemorial that is the cause of bodily suffering and distress. As soon as the living entity becomes aloof from the activities of the body, he becomes free from the reactions as well. As long as he is in the city of body, he appears to be the master of it, but actually he is neither its proprietor nor controller of its actions and reactions. He is simply in the midst of the material ocean, struggling for existence. The waves of the ocean are tossing him, and he has no control over them. His best solution is to get out of the water by transcendental K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That alone will save him from all turmoil.\u00a0"

      "The Sanskrit word vibhu\u1e25 means the Supreme Lord who is full of unlimited knowledge, riches, strength, fame, beauty and renunciation. He is always satisfied in Himself, undisturbed by sinful or pious activities. He does not create a particular situation for any living entity, but the living entity, bewildered by ignorance, desires to be put into certain conditions of life, and thereby his chain of action and reaction begins. A living entity is, by superior nature, full of knowledge. Nevertheless, he is prone to be influenced by ignorance due to his limited power. The Lord is omnipotent, but the living entity is not. The Lord is vibhu, or omniscient, but the living entity is a\u1e47u, or atomic. Because he is a living soul, he has the capacity to desire by his free will. Such desire is fulfilled only by the omnipotent Lord. And so, when the living entity is bewildered in his desires, the Lord allows him to fulfill those desires, but the Lord is never responsible for the actions and reactions of the particular situation which may be desired. Being in a bewildered condition, therefore, the embodied soul identifies himself with the circumstantial material body and becomes subjected to the temporary misery and happiness of life. The Lord is the constant companion of the living entity as Param\u0101tm\u0101, or the Supersoul, and therefore He can understand the desires of the individual soul, as one can smell the flavor of a flower by being near it. Desire is a subtle form of conditioning of the living entity. The Lord fulfills his desire as he deserves: Man proposes and God disposes. The individual is not, therefore, omnipotent in fulfilling his desires. The Lord, however, can fulfill all desires, and the Lord, being neutral to everyone, does not interfere with the desires of the minute independant living entities. However, when one desires K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Lord takes special care and encourages one to desire in such a way that one can attain to Him and be eternally happy. The Vedic hymn therefore declares:\u00a0",
      "eṣa u hy eva sādhu karma kārayati taṁ yamebhyo lokebhya unninīṣate \n eṣa u evāsādhu karma kārayati yamadho ninīṣate.",
      "ajño jantur anīso ‘yam ātmanaḥ sukha-duḥkhayoḥ \n īśvara-prerito gacchet svargaṁ vāśvabhram eva ca.",
      "\u201cThe Lord engages the living entity in pious activities so he may be elevated. The Lord engages him in impious activities so he may go to hell. The living entity is completely dependant in his distress and happiness. By the will of the Supreme he can go to heaven or hell, as a cloud is driven by the air.\u201d\u00a0",
      "Therefore the embodied soul, by his immemorial desire to avoid K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, causes his own bewilderment. Consequently, although he is constitutionally eternal, blissful and cognizant, due to the littleness of his existence he forgets his constitutional position of service to the Lord and is thus entrapped by nescience. And, under the spell of ignorance, the living entity claims that the Lord is responsible for his conditional existence. The Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras also confirm this:\u00a0",

It is stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, \u201csarva\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101na-plavena,\u201d \u201cj\u00f1\u0101n\u0101gni\u1e25 sarva-karm\u0101\u1e47i\u201d and \u201cna hi j\u00f1\u0101nena sad\u1e5b\u015bam.\u201d Knowledge is always highly esteemed. And what is that knowledge? Perfect knowledge is achieved when one surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as is said in the Seventh Chapter, 19th verse: bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m ante j\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyate. After passing through many, many births, when one perfect in knowledge surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or when one attains K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then everything is revealed to him, as the sun reveals everything in the daytime. The living entity is bewildered in so many ways. For instance, when he thinks himself God, unceremoniously, he actually falls into the last snare of nescience. If a living entity is God, then how can he become bewildered by nescience? Does God become bewildered by nescience? If so, then nescience, or Satan, is greater than God. Real knowledge can be obtained from a person who is in perfect K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Therefore, one has to seek out such a bona fide spiritual master and, under him, learn what K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is. The spiritual master can drive away all nescience, as the sun drives away darkness. Even though a person may be in full knowledge that he is not this body but is transcendental to the body, he still may not be able to discriminate between the soul and the Supersoul. However, he can know everything well if he cares to take shelter of the perfect, bona fide K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious spiritual master. One can know God and one\u2019s relationship with God only when one actually meets a representative of God. A representative of God never claims that he is God, although he is paid all the respect ordinarily paid to God because he has knowledge of God. One has to learn the distinction between God and the living entity. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore stated in the Second Chapter (2.12) Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be. that every living being is individual and that the Lord also is individual. They were all individuals in the past, they are individuals at present, and they will continue to be individuals in the future, even after liberation. At night we see everything as one in the darkness, but in day when the sun is up, we see everything in its real identity. Identity with individuality in spiritual life is real knowledge.\u00a0"

      "The Supreme Transcendental Truth is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The whole Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 centers around the declaration of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the version of all Vedic literature. Paratattva means the Supreme Reality, who is understood by the knowers of the Supreme as Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n. Bhagav\u0101n, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the last word in the Absolute. There is nothing more than that.TheLord says, matta\u1e25 paratara\u1e41 n\u0101nyat ki\u00f1cit asti dhana\u00f1jaya. Impersonal Brahman is also supported by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: brahma\u1e47o prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ham. Therefore in all ways K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Reality. One whose mind, intelligence, faith and refuge are always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or, in other words, one who is fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is undoubtedly washed clean of all misgivings and is in perfect knowledge in everything concerning transcendence. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person can thoroughly understand that there is duality (simultaneous identity and individuality) in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and, equipped with such transcendental knowledge, one can make steady progress on the path of liberation.\u00a0"

Such an understanding of the Supreme is real knowledge. As far as the bodies are concerned in different castes or different species of life, the Lord is equally kind to everyone because He treats every living being as a friend yet maintains Himself as Param\u0101tm\u0101 regardless of the circumstances of the living entities. The Lord as Param\u0101tm\u0101 is present both in the outcaste and in the br\u0101hma\u1e47a, although the body of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a and that of an outcaste are not the same. The bodies are material productions of different modes of material nature, but the soul and the Supersoul within the body are of the same spiritual quality. The similarity in the quality of the soul and the Supersoul, however, does not make them equal in quantity, for the individual soul is present only in that particular body, whereas the Param\u0101tm\u0101 is present in each and every body. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person has full knowledge of this, and therefore he is truly learned and has equal vision. The similar characteristics of the soul and Supersoul are that they are both conscious, eternal and blissful. But the difference is that the individual soul is conscious within the limited jurisdiction of the body, whereas the Supersoul is conscious of all bodies. The Supersoul is present in all bodies without distinction.\u00a0"

  "purport": [
      "Being engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one can immediately understand one’s spiritual identity, and then one can understand the Supreme Lord by means of devotional service. When he is well situated in devotional service, one comes to the transcendental position, qualified to feel the presence of the Lord in the sphere of one’s activity. This particular position is called liberation in the Supreme.",
      "After explaining the above principles of liberation in the Supreme, the Lord gives instruction to Arjuna as to how one can come to that position by the practice of mysticism or yoga, known as aṣṭāṅga-yoga, which is divisible into an eightfold procedure called yama, niyama, āsana, prāṇāyāma, pratyāhāra, dhāraṇā, dhyāna, and samādhi. In the Sixth Chapter the subject of yoga is explicitly detailed, and at the end of the Fifth it is only preliminarily explained. One has to drive out the sense objects such as sound, touch, form, taste and smell by the pratyāhāra (breathing) process in yoga, and then keep the vision of the eyes between the two eyebrows and concentrate on the tip of the nose with half closed lids. There is no benefit in closing the eyes altogether, because then there is every chance of falling asleep. Nor is there benefit in opening the eyes completely, because then there is the hazard of being attracted by sense objects. The breathing movement is restrained within the nostrils by neutralizing the up- and down-moving air within the body. By practice of such yoga one is able to gain control over the senses, refrain from outward sense objects, and thus prepare oneself for liberation in the Supreme.",
      "This yoga process helps one become free from all kinds of fear and anger and thus feel the presence of the Supersoul in the transcendental situation. In other words, Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the easiest process of executing yoga principles. This will be thoroughly explained in the next chapter. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person, however, being always engaged in devotional service, does not risk losing his senses to some other engagement. This is a better way of controlling the senses than by the aṣṭāṅga-yoga."

      "The conditioned souls within the clutches of illusory energy are all anxious to attain peace in the material world. But they do not know the formula for peace, which is explained in this part of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The greatest peace formula is simply this: Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the beneficiary in all human activities. Men should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because He is the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater than He. He is greater than the greatest of the demigods, Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101. In the Vedas the Supreme Lord is described as tam \u012b\u015bvar\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 parama\u1e41 mahe\u015bvaram. Under the spell of illusion, living entities are trying to be lords of all they survey, but actually they are dominated by the material energy of the Lord. The Lord is the master of material nature, and the conditioned souls are under the stringent rules of material nature. Unless one understands these bare facts, it is not possible to achieve peace in the world either individually or collectively. This is the sense of Kssna consciousness: Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme predominator, and all living entities, including the great demigods, are His subordinates. One can attain perfect peace only in complete K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u00a0",
      "This Fifth Chapter is a practical explanation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, generally known as karma-yoga. The question of mental speculation as to how karma-yoga can give liberation is answered herewith. To work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is to work with the complete knowledge of the Lord as the predominator. Such work is not different from transcendental knowledge. Direct K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is bhakti-yoga, and j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga is a path leading to bhakti-yoga. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness means to work in full knowledge of one\u2019s relationship with the Supreme Absolute, and the perfection of this consciousness is full knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure soul is the eternal servant of God as His fragmental part and parcel. He comes into contact with m\u0101y\u0101 (illusion) due to the desire to lord it over m\u0101y\u0101, and that is the cause of his many sufferings. As long as he is in contact with matter, he has to execute work in terms of material necessities. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, brings one into spiritual life even while one is within the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by practice in the material world. The more one is advanced, the more he is freed from the clutches of matter. The Lord is not partial toward anyone. Everything depends on one\u2019s practical performance of duties in an effort to control the senses and conquer the influence of desire and anger. And, attaining K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by controlling the above-mentioned passions, one remains factually in the transcendental stage, or brahman-nirv\u0101\u1e47a. The eightfold yoga mysticism is automatically practiced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness because the ultimate purpose is served. There is gradual process of elevation in the practice of yama, niyama, \u0101sana, praty\u0101h\u0101ra, dhy\u0101na, dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, and sam\u0101dhi. But these only preface perfection by devotional service, which alone can award peace to the human being. It is the highest perfection of life.\u00a0",
      "Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fifth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of Karma-yoga, or Action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Consciousness.\u00a0"

      "In this chapter the Lord explains that the process of the eightfold yoga system is a means to control the mind and the senses. However, this is very difficult for people in general to perform, especially in the age of Kali. Although the eightfold yoga system is recommended in this chapter, the Lord emphasizes that the process of karma-yoga, or acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is better. Everyone acts in this world to maintain his family and their paraphernalia, but no one is working without some self-interest, some personal gratification, be it concentrated or extended. The criterion of perfection is to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and not with a view to enjoying the fruits of work. To act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the duty of every living entity because all are constitutionally parts and parcels of the Supreme. The parts of the body work for the satisfaction of the whole body. The limbs of the body do not act for self-satisfaction but for the satisfaction of the complete whole. Similarly, the living entity who acts for satisfaction of the supreme whole and not for personal satisfaction is the perfect sanny\u0101s\u012b, the perfect yog\u012b.\u00a0",
      "The sanny\u0101s\u012bs sometimes artificially think that they have become liberated from all material duties, and therefore they cease to perform agnihotra yaj\u00f1as (fire sacrifices), but actually they are self-interested because their goal is becoming one with the impersonal Brahman. Such a desire is greater than any material desire, but it is not without self-interest. Similarly, the mystic yog\u012b who practices the yoga system with half-open eyes, ceasing all material activities, desires some satisfaction for his personal self. But a person acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness works for the satisfaction of the whole, without self-interest. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person has no desire for self-satisfaction. His criterion of success is the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus he is the perfect sanny\u0101s\u012b, or perfect yog\u012b. Lord Caitanya, the highest perfectional symbol of renunciation, prays in this way:\u00a0",
      "\u201cO Almighty Lord, I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor to enjoy beautiful women. Nor do I want any number of followers. What I want only is the causeless mercy of Your devotional service in my life, birth after birth.\u201d\u00a0"

      "Real sanny\u0101sa-yoga or bhakti means that one should know his constitutional position as the living entity, and act accordingly. The living entity has no separate independant identity. He is the marginal energy of the Supreme. When he is entrapped by material energy, he is conditioned, and when he is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, or aware of the spiritual energy, then he is in his real and natural state of life. Therefore, when one is in complete knowledge, one ceases all material sense gratification, or renounces all kinds of sense gratificatory activities. This is practiced by the yog\u012bs who restrain the senses from material attachment. But a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has no opportunity to engage his senses in anything which is not for the purpose of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is simultaneously a sanny\u0101s\u012b and a yog\u012b. The purpose of knowledge and of restraining the senses, as prescribed in the j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga processes, is automatically served in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If one is unable to give up the activities of his selfish nature, then j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga are of no avail. The real aim is for a living entity to give up all selfish satisfaction and to be prepared to satisfy the Supreme. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person has no desire for any kind of self-enjoyment. He is always engaged for the enjoyment of the Supreme. One who has no information of the Supreme must therefore be engaged in self-satisfaction because no one can stand on the platform of inactivity.

      "The word \u0101tm\u0101 denotes body, mind and soul-depending upon different circumstances. In the yoga system, the mind and the conditioned soul are especially important. Since the mind is the central point of yoga practice, \u0101tm\u0101 refers here to the mind. The purpose of the yoga system is to control the mind and to draw it away from attachment to sense objects. It is stressed herein that the mind must be so trained that it can deliver the conditioned soul from the mire of nescience. In material existence one is subjected to the influence of the mind and the senses. In fact, the pure soul is entangled in the material world because of the mind\u2019s ego which desires to lord it over material nature. Therefore, the mind should be trained so that it will not be attracted by the glitter of material nature, and in this way the conditioned soul may be saved. One should not degrade oneself by attraction to sense objects. The more one is attracted by sense objects, the more one becomes entangled in material existence. The best way to disentangle oneself is to always engage the mind in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The word hi is used for emphasizing this point, i.e., that one must do this. It is also said:\u00a0",
      "mana eva manuṣyāṇāṁ kāraṇaṁ bandha-mokṣayoḥ \n bandhāya viṣayāsaṅgo muktyai nirviṣayaṁ manaḥ.",
      "\u201cFor man, mind is the cause of bondage and mind is the cause of liberation. Mind absorbed in sense objects is the cause of bondage, and mind detached from the sense objects is the cause of liberation.\u201d Therefore, the mind which is always engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the cause of supreme liberation.\u00a0"

      "The purpose of practicing eightfold yoga is to control the mind in order to make it a friend in discharging the human mission. Unless the mind is controlled, the practice of yoga (for show) is simply a waste of time. One who cannot control his mind lives always with the greatest enemy, and thus his life and its mission are spoiled. The constitutional position of the living entity is to carry out the order of the superior. As long as one\u2019s mind remains an unconquered enemy, one has to serve the dictations of lust, anger, avarice, illusion, etc. But when the mind is conquered, one voluntarily agrees to abide by the dictation of the Personality of Godhead, who is situated within the heart of everyone as Param\u0101tm\u0101. Real yoga practice entails meeting the Param\u0101tm\u0101 within the heart and then following His dictation.

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness means, concisely, to be always engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. But those who are attached to the impersonal Brahman or the localized Supersoul are also partially K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, because impersonal Brahman is the spiritual ray of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Supersoul is the all-pervading partial expansion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus the impersonalist and the meditator are also indirectly K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. A directly K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is the topmost transcendentalist because such a devotee knows what is meant by Brahman or Param\u0101tm\u0101. His knowledge of the Absolute Truth is perfect, whereas the impersonalist and the meditative yog\u012b are imperfectly K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.\u00a0",
      "Nevertheless, all of these are instructed herewith to be constantly engaged in their particular pursuits so that they may come to the highest perfection sooner or later. The first business of a transcendentalist is to keep the mind always on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should always think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and not forget Him even for a moment. Concentration of the mind on the Supreme is called sam\u0101dhi or trance. In order to concentrate the mind, one should always remain in seclusion and avoid disturbance by external objects. He should be very careful to accept favorable and reject unfavorable conditions that affect his realization. And, in perfect determination, he should not hanker after unnecessary material things that entangle him by feelings of possessiveness.\u00a0",
      "All these perfections and precautions are perfectly executed when one is directly in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness because direct K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness means self-abnegation, wherein there is very little chance for material possessiveness. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b characterizes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in this way:\u00a0",

      "\u201cWhen one is not attached to anything, but at the same time accepts everything in relation to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one is rightly situated above possessiveness. On the other hand, one who rejects everything without knowledge of its relationship to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not as complete in his renunciation.\u201d\u00a0"

      "“Sacred place” refers to places of pilgrimage. In India the yogīs, the transcendentalists or the devotees all leave home and reside in sacred places such as Prayāg, Mathurā, Vṛndāvana, Hṛṣīkeśa, and Hardwar and in solitude practice yoga where the sacred rivers like the Yamunā and the Ganges flow. But often this is not possible, especially for Westerners. The so-called yoga societies in big cities may be successful in earning material benefit, but they are not at all suitable for the actual practice of yoga. One who is not self-controlled and whose mind is not undisturbed cannot practice meditation. Therefore, in the Bṛhan-Nāradīya Purāṇa it is said that in the Kali-yuga (the present yuga or age) when people in general are short-lived, slow in spiritual realization and always disturbed by various anxieties, the best means of spiritual realization is chanting the holy name of the Lord.",

      "The goal of life is to know Kṛṣṇa, who is situated within the heart of every living being as Paramātmā, the four-handed Viṣṇu form. The yoga process is practiced in order to discover and see this localized form of Viṣṇu, and not for any other purpose. The localized Viṣṇu-mūrti is the plenary representation of Kṛṣṇa dwelling within one’s heart. One who has no program to realize this Viṣṇu-murti is uselessly engaged in mock-yoga practice and is certainly wasting his time. Kṛṣṇā is the ultimate goal of life, and the Viṣṇu-murti situated in one’s heart is the object of yoga practice. To realize this Viṣṇu-murti within the heart, one has to observe complete abstinence from sex life; therefore one has to leave home and live alone in a secluded place, remaining seated as mentioned above. One cannot enjoy sex life daily at home or elsewhere and attend a so-called yoga class and thus become a yogī. One has to practice controlling the mind and avoiding all kinds of sense gratification, of which sex life is the chief. In the rules of celibacy written by the great sage Yājñavalkya it is said:",
      "karmaṇā manasā vācā\n sarvāvasthāsu sarvadā\n sarvatra maithuṇa-tyāgo\n brahmacaryaṁ pracakṣate.",
      "“The vow of brahmacarya is meant to help one completely abstain from sex indulgence in work, words and mind-at all times, under all circumstances, and in all places.” No one can perform correct yoga practice through sex indulgence. Brahmacarya is taught, therefore, from childhood when one has no knowledge of sex life. Children at the age of five are sent to the guru-kula, or the place of the spiritual master, and the master trains the young boys in the strict discipline of becoming brahmacārīs. Without such practice, no one can make advancement in any yoga, whether it be dhyāna, jñāna or bhakti. One who, however, follows the rules and regulations of married life, having sexual relationship only with his wife (and that also under regulation), is also called brahmacārī. Such a restrained householder brahmacārī may be accepted in the bhakti school, but the jñāna and dhyāna schools do not admit even householder brahmacārīs. They require complete abstinence without compromise. In the bhakti school, a householder brahmacārī is allowed controlled sex life because the cult of bhakti-yoga is so powerful that one automatically loses sexual attraction, being engaged in the superior service of the Lord. In the Bhagavad-gītā it is said:",
      "viṣayā vinivartante\n nirāhārasya dehinaḥ\n rasa-varjaṁ raso ‘py asya\n paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate\n",
      "Whereas others are forced to restrain themselves from sense gratification, a devotee of the Lord automatically refrains because of superior taste. Other than the devotee, no one has any information of that superior taste.",
      "Vigatabhīḥ. One cannot be fearless unless one is fully in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. A conditioned soul is fearful due to his perverted memory, his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with Kṛṣṇa. The Bhāgavatam says, bhayaṁ dvitīyābhiniveśataḥ syād īśād apetasya viparyayo ‘smṛtiḥ: Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the only basis for fearlessness. Therefore, perfect practice is possible for a person who is Kṛṣṇa conscious. And since the ultimate goal of yoga practice is to see the Lord within, a Kṛṣṇa conscious person is already the best of all yogīs. The principles of the yoga system mentioned herein are different from those of the popular so-called yoga societies."

      "The ultimate goal in practicing yoga is now clearly explained. Yoga practice is not meant for attaining any kind of material facility; it is to enable the cessation of all material existence. One who seeks an improvement in health or aspires after material perfection is no yog\u012b according to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Nor does cessation of material existence entail one\u2019s entering into \u201cthe void,\u201d which is only a myth. There is no void anywhere within the creation of the Lord. Rather, the cessation of material existence enables one to enter into the spiritual sky, the abode of the Lord. The abode of the Lord is also clearly described in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as that place where there is no need of sun, moon, nor electricity. All the planets in the spiritual kingdom are self-illuminated like the sun in the material sky. The kingdom of God is everywhere, but the spiritual sky and the planets thereof are called para\u1e41 dh\u0101ma, or superior abodes.\u00a0",

In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is clearly stated (goloka eva nivasaty akhil\u0101tma-bh\u016bta\u1e25) that the Lord, although residing always in His abode called Goloka, is the all-pervading Brahman and the localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 as well by dint of His superior spiritual energies. No one can reach the spiritual sky or enter into the eternal abode (Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana) of the Lord without the proper understanding of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His plenary expansion Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.

One who eats more than required will dream very much while sleeping, and he must consequently sleep more than is required. One should not sleep more than six hours daily. One who sleeps more than six hours out of twenty-four is certainly influenced by the mode of ignorance. A person in the mode of ignorance is lazy and prone to sleep a great deal.

Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is offered, according to the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (Bg. 9.26)\u012bt\u0101 If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it., vegetables, flowers, fruits, grains, milk, etc. In this way, a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness becomes automatically trained not to accept food not meant for human consumption, or which is not in the category of goodness.

This perfectional stage can automatically be attained by persons in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, as is stated in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (9.4.18-20)\u015ar\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam 9.4.18-20Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a always engaged his mind in meditating upon the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, his words in describing the glories of the Lord, his hands in cleansing the Lord's temple, and his ears in hearing the words spoken by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He engaged his eyes in seeing the Deity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's temples and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's places like Mathur\u0101 and V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, he engaged his sense of touch in touching the bodies of the Lord's devotees, he engaged his sense of smell in smelling the fragrance of tulas\u012b offered to the Lord, and he engaged his tongue in tasting the Lord's pras\u0101da. He engaged his legs in walking to the holy places and temples of the Lord, his head in bowing down before the Lord, and all his desires in serving the Lord, twenty-four hours a day. Indeed, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a never desired anything for his own sense gratification. He engaged all his senses in devotional service, in various engagements related to the Lord. This is the way to increase attachment for the Lord and be completely free from all material desires.:\u00a0",
      "sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānavarṇane \n karau harer mandira-mārjanādiṣu śrutiṁ cakārācyuta-sat-kathodaye \n mukunda-liṅgālaya-darśane dṛśau tad-bhṛtyagātra-sparśe ‘ṅga-saṅgamam \n ghrāṇaṁ ca tat-pāda-saroja-saurabhe śrīmat tulasyā rasanāṁ tad-arpite \n pādau hareḥ kṣetra-padānusarpaṇe śiro hṛṣīkeśa-padābhivandane \n kāmaṁ ca dāsye na tu kāma-kāmyayā yathottama-śloka-janāśrayā ratiḥ",
      "\u201cKing Ambar\u012b\u1e63a first of all engaged his mind on the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; then, one after another, he engaged his words in describing the transcendental qualities of the Lord, his hands in mopping the temple of the Lord, his ears in hearing of the activities of the Lord, his eyes in seeing the transcendental forms of the Lord, his body in touching the bodies of the devotees, his sense of smell in smelling the scents of the lotus flower offered to the Lord, his tongue in tasting the tulas\u012b leaf offered at the lotus feet of the Lord, his legs in going to places of pilgrimage and the temple of the Lord, his head in offering obeisances unto the Lord and his desires in executing the mission of the Lord. All these transcendental activities are quite befitting a pure devotee.\u201d\u00a0",
      "This transcendental stage may be inexpressible subjectively by the followers of the impersonalist path, but it becomes very easy and practical for a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, as is apparent in the above description of the engagements of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a. Unless the mind is fixed on the lotus feet of the Lord by constant remembrance, such transcendental engagements are not practical. In the devotional service of the Lord, therefore, these prescribed activities are called arcan\u0101, or engaging all the senses in the service of the Lord. The senses and the mind require engagements. Simple abnegation is not practical. Therefore, for people in general— especially those who are not in the renounced order of life— transcendental engagement of the senses and the mind as described above is the perfect process for transcendental achievement, which is called yukta in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\u00a0"

  "translation": "The stage of perfection is called trance, or samādhi, when one’s mind is completely restrained from material mental activities by practice of yoga. This is characterized by one’s ability to see the self by the pure mind and to relish and rejoice in the self. In that joyous state, one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness and enjoys himself through transcendental senses. Established thus, one never departs from the truth, and upon gaining this he thinks there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a position, one is never shaken, even in the midst of greatest difficulty. This indeed is actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact.",
  "purport": [
      "By practice of yoga one becomes gradually detached from material concepts. This is the primary characteristic of the yoga principle. And after this, one becomes situated in trance, or samādhi which means that the yogī realizes the Supersoul through transcendental mind and intelligence, without any of the misgivings of identifying the self with the Superself. Yoga practice is more or less based on the principles of the Patañjali system. Some unauthorized commentators try to identify the individual soul with the Supersoul, and the monists think this to be liberation, but they do not understand the real purpose of the Patañjali system of yoga. There is an acceptance of transcendental pleasure in the Patañjali system, but the monists do not accept this transcendental pleasure out of fear of jeopardizing the theory of oneness. The duality of knowledge and knower is not accepted by the nondualist, but in this verse transcendental pleasure-realized through transcendental senses-is accepted. And this is corroborated by the Patañjali Muni, the famous exponent of the yoga system. The great sage declares in his Yoga-sūtras: puruṣārtha-śūnyānāṁ guṇānāṁ pratiprasavaḥ kaivalyaṁ svarūpa-pratiṣṭhā vā citi-śaktir iti.",
      "This citi-śakti, or internal potency, is transcendental. Puruṣārtha means material religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and, at the end, the attempt to become one with the Supreme. This “oneness with the Supreme” is called kaivalyam by the monist. But according to Patañjali, this kaivalyam is an internal, or transcendental, potency by which the living entity becomes aware of his constitutional position. In the words of Lord Caitanya, this state of affairs is called ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam, or clearance of the impure mirror of the mind. This “clearance” is actually liberation, or bhava-mahādāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam. The theory of nirvāṇa-also preliminary-corresponds with this principle. In the Bhāgavatam this is called svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ. The Bhagavad-gītā also confirms this situation in this verse. ",
      "After nirvāṇa, or material cessation, there is the manifestation of spiritual activities, or devotional service of the Lord, known as Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In the words of the Bhāgavatam, svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ: this is the “real life of the living entity.” Māyā, or illusion, is the condition of spiritual life contaminated by material infection. Liberation from this material infection does not mean destruction of the original eternal position of the living entity. Patañjali also accepts this by his words kaivalyam svarūpa-pratiṣṭhā vā citi-śaktir iti. This citi-śakti or transcendental pleasure, is real life. This is confirmed in the Vedānta-sūtras as ānandamayo ‘bhyāsāt. This natural transcendental pleasure is the ultimate goal of yoga and is easily achieved by execution of devotional service, or bhakti-yoga. Bhaktiyoga will be vividly described in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gītā. ",
      "In the yoga system, as described in this chapter, there are two kinds of samādhi, called samprajñāta-samādhi and asamprajñāta-samādhi. When one becomes situated in the transcendental position by various philosophical researches, it is called samprajñāta-samādhi. In the asamprajñāta-samādhi there is no longer any connection with mundane pleasure, for one is then transcendental to all sorts of happiness derived from the senses. When the yogī is once situated in that transcendental position, he is never shaken from it. Unless the yogī is able to reach this position, he is unsuccessful. Today’s so-called yoga practice, which involves various sense pleasures, is contradictory. A yogī indulging in sex and intoxication is a mockery. Even those yogīs who are attracted by the siddhis (perfections) in the process of yoga are not perfectly situated. If the yogīs are attracted by the by-products of yoga, then they cannot attain the stage of perfection, as is stated in this verse. Persons, therefore, indulging in the make-show practice of gymnastic feats or siddhis should know that the aim of yoga is lost in that way.",
      "The best practice of yoga in this age is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which is not baffling. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person is so happy in his occupation that he does not aspire after any other happiness. There are many impediments, especially in this age of hypocrisy, to practicing haṭha-yoga, dhyāna-yoga, and jñāna-yoga, but there is no such problem in executing karma-yoga or bhakti-yoga. ",
      "As long as the material body exists, one has to meet the demands of the body, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating. But a person who is in pure bhakti-yoga or in Kṛṣṇa consciousness does not arouse the senses while meeting the demands of the body. Rather, he accepts the bare necessities of life, making the best use of a bad bargain, and enjoys transcendental happiness in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He is callous toward incidental occurrences-such as accidents, disease, scarcity and even the death of a most dear relative-but he is always alert to execute his duties in Kṛṣṇa consciousness or bhakti-yoga. Accidents never deviate him from his duty. As stated in the Bhagavad-gītā, āgamāpāyino ‘nityās tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata. He endures all such incidental occurences because he knows that they come and go and do not affect his duties. In this way he achieves the highest perfection in yoga practice."

A sparrow laid her eggs on the shore of the ocean, but the big ocean carried away the eggs on its waves. The sparrow became very upset and asked the ocean to return her eggs. The ocean did not even consider her appeal. So the sparrow decided to dry up the ocean. She began to pick out the water in her small beak, and everyone laughed at her for her impossible determination. The news of her activity spread, and at last Garu\u1e0da, the gigantic bird carrier of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, heard it. He became compassionate toward his small sister bird, and so he came to see the sparrow. Garu\u1e0da was very pleased by the determination of the small sparrow, and he promised to help. Thus Garu\u1e0da at once asked the ocean to return her eggs lest he himself take up the work of the sparrow. The ocean was frightened at this, and returned the eggs. Thus the sparrow became happy by the grace of Garu\u1e0da.\u00a0",
      "Similarly, the practice of yoga, especially bhakti-yoga in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, may appear to be a very difficult job. But if anyone follows the principles with great determination, the Lord will surely help, for God helps those who help themselves.\u00a0"

One who controls the mind (and therefore the senses as well) is called gosv\u0101m\u012b, or sv\u0101m\u012b, and one who is controlled by the mind is called god\u0101sa, or the servant of the senses. A gosv\u0101m\u012b knows the standard of sense happiness. In transcendental sense happiness, the senses are engaged in the service of H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba or the supreme owner of the senses— K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with purified senses is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That is the way of bringing the senses under full control.

The Lord in His Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature is situated within both the heart of the dog and that of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. The perfect yog\u012b knows that the Lord is eternally transcendental and is not materially affected by His presence in either a dog or a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. That is the supreme neutrality of the Lord. The individual soul is also situated in the individual heart, but he is not present in all hearts. That is the distinction between the individual soul and the Supersoul. One who is not factually in the practice of yoga cannot see so clearly. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person can see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the heart of both the believer and nonbeliever. In the sm\u1e5bti this is confirmed as follows: \u0101tatatv\u0101c ca m\u0101t\u1e5btv\u0101d \u0101tm\u0101 hi paramo hari\u1e25.\u00a0",
      "The Lord, being the source of all beings, is like the mother and the maintainer. As the mother is neutral to all different kinds of children, the Supreme Father (or Mother) is also. Consequently the Supersoul is always in every living being. Outwardly, also, every living being is situated in the energy of the Lord. As will be explained in the Seventh Chapter, the Lord has, primarily, two energies— the spiritual (or superior) and the material (or inferior). The living entity, although part of the superior energy, is conditioned by the inferior energy; the living entity is always in the Lord\u2019s energy. Every living entity is situated in Him in one way or another. The yog\u012b sees equally because he sees that all living entities, although in different situations according to the results of fruitive work, in all circumstances remain the servants of God. While in the material energy, the living entity serves the material senses; and while in spiritual energy, he serves the Supreme Lord directly. In either case the living entity is the servant of God. This vision of equality is perfect in a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u00a0"

And the cause of happiness is knowing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be the supreme enjoyer of all the activities of the human being. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the proprietor of all lands and planets. The perfect yog\u012b is the sincerest friend of all living entities. He knows that the living being who is conditioned by the modes of material nature is subjected to the threefold material miseries due to forgetfulness of his relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Because one in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is happy, he tries to distribute the knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a everywhere. Since the perfect yog\u012b tries to broadcast the importance of becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, he is the best philanthropist in the world, and he is the dearest servitor of the Lord. Na tasm\u0101t ka\u015bcid me priyak\u1e5bt tama\u1e25. In other words, a devotee of the Lord always looks to the welfare of all living entities, and in this way he is factually the friend of everyone. He is the best yog\u012b because he does not desire perfection in yoga for his personal benefit, but tries for others also. He does not envy his fellow living entities. Here is a contrast between a pure devotee of the Lord and a yog\u012b interested only in his personal elevation. The yog\u012b who has withdrawn to a secluded place in order to meditate perfectly may not be as perfect as a devotee who is trying his best to turn every man toward K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u00a0"

It is not possible for an ordinary man to leave home and go to a secluded place in the mountains or jungles to practice yoga in this age of Kali. The present age is characterized by a bitter struggle for a life of short duration. People are not serious about self-realization even by simple, practical means, and what to speak of this difficult yoga system, which regulates the mode of living, the manner of sitting, selection of place, and detachment of the mind from material engagements. As a practical man, Arjuna thought it was impossible to follow this system of yoga, even though he was favorably endowed in many ways. He belonged to the royal family and was highly elevated in terms of numerous qualities; he was a great warrior, he had great longevity, and, above all, he was the most intimate friend of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Five thousand years ago, Arjuna had much better facilities then we do now, yet he refused to accept this system of yoga. In fact, we do not find any record in history of his practicing it at any time. Therefore this system must be considered generally impossible in this age of Kali. Of course it may be possible for some very few, rare men, but for the people in general it is an impossible proposal. If this were so five thousand years ago, then what of the present day? Those who are imitating this yoga system in different so-called schools and societies, although complacent, are certainly wasting their time. They are completely in ignorance of the desired goal.\u00a0"

The simile used here is appropriate: one cannot capture the blowing wind. And it is even more difficult to capture the turbulent mind.

      "The difficulty of controlling the obstinate mind, as expressed by Arjuna, is accepted by the Personality of Godhead. But at the same time He suggests that by practice and detachment it is possible. What is that practice? In the present age no one can observe strict rules and regulations, such as placing oneself in a sacred place, focusing the mind on the Supersoul, restraining the senses and mind, observing celibacy, remaining alone, etc. By the practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, one engages in nine types of devotional service to the Lord. The first and foremost of such devotional engagements is hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is a very powerful transcendental method for purging the mind of all misgivings. The more one hears about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the more one becomes enlightened and detached from everything that draws the mind away from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By detaching the mind from activities not devoted to the Lord, one can very easily learn vair\u0101gya. Vair\u0101gya means detachment from matter and engagement of the mind in spirit. Impersonal spiritual detachment is more difficult than attaching the mind to the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is practical because by hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one becomes automatically attached to the Supreme Spirit. This attachment is called pare\u015b\u0101nubh\u016bti spiritual satisfaction. It is just like the feeling of satisfaction a hungry man has for every morsel of food he eats. Similarly, by discharge of devotional service, one feels transcendental satisfaction as the mind becomes detached from material objectives. It is something like curing a disease by expert treatment and appropriate diet. Hearing of the transcendental activities of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is therefore expert treatment for the mad mind, and eating the foodstuff offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the appropriate diet for the suffering patient. This treatment is the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u00a0"

A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person easily achieves the result of yoga practice without separate endeavor, but a yoga practitioner cannot achieve success without becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.\u00a0"

      "The path of self-realization or mysticism is described in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The basic principle of self-realization is knowledge that the living entity is not this material body but that he is different from it and that his happiness is in eternal life, bliss and knowledge. These are transcendental, beyond both body and mind. Self-realization is sought by the path of knowledge, the practice of the eightfold system or by bhakti-yoga. In each of these processes one has to realize the constitutional position of the living entity, his relationship with God, and the activities whereby he can reestablish the lost link and achieve the highest perfectional stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Following any of the above-mentioned three methods, one is sure to reach the supreme goal sooner or later. This was asserted by the Lord in the Second Chapter: even a little endeavor on the transcendental path offers a great hope for deliverance. Out of these three methods, the path of bhakti-yoga is especially suitable for this age because it is the most direct method of God realization. To be doubly assured, Arjuna is asking Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to confirm His former statement. One may sincerely accept the path of self-realization, but the process of cultivation of knowledge and the practice of the eightfold yoga system are generally very difficult for this age. Therefore, despite constant endeavor, one may fail for many reasons. First of all, one may not be following the process. To pursue the transcendental path is more or less to declare war on illusory energy. Consequently, whenever a person tries to escape the clutches of the illusory energy, she tries to defeat the practitioner by various allurements. A conditioned soul is already allured by the modes of material energy, and there is every chance of being allured again, even while performing transcendental disciplines. This is called yog\u0101t calita-m\u0101nasa\u1e25: deviation from the transcendental path. Arjuna is inquisitive to know the results of deviation from the path of self-realization.\u00a0"

      "There are two ways to progress. Those who are materialists have no interest in Transcendence; therefore they are more interested in material advancement by economic development, or in promotion to the higher planets by appropriate work. When one takes to the path of Transcendence, one has to cease all material activities and sacrifice all forms of so-called material happiness. If the aspiring transcendentalist fails, then he apparently loses both ways; in other words, he can enjoy neither material happiness nor spiritual success. He has no position; he is like a riven cloud. A cloud in the sky sometimes deviates from a small cloud and joins a big one. But if it cannot join a big one, then it is blown away by the wind and becomes a nonentity in the vast sky. The brahma\u1e47a\u1e25 pathi is the path of transcendental realization through knowing oneself to be spiritual in essence, part and parcel of the Supreme Lord who is manifested as Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the fullest manifestation of the Supreme Absolute Truth, and therefore one who is surrendered to the Supreme Person is a successful transcendentalist. To reach this goal of life through Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101 realization takes many, many births: Bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m ante. Therefore the supermost of transcendental realization is bhakti-yoga or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the direct method.\u00a0"

On the other hand, a nondevotee, though fully engaged in occupational duties, does not gain anything. \u015ar\u012b N\u0101rada Muni instructs Vy\u0101sadeva as follows:\u00a0",
      "tyaktvā sva-dharmaṁ caraṇāmbujaṁ harer \n bhajann apakko ‘tha patet tato yadi \n yatra kva vābhadram abhūd amuṣya kiṁ \n ko vārtha āpto ‘bhajatāṁ sva-dharmataḥ",

On the other hand a nondevotee may fully engage in his occupational duties and yet not gain anything.\u201d For material prospects, there are many activities both scriptural and customary. A transcendentalist is supposed to give up all material activities for the sake of spiritual advancement in life, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One may argue that by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one may attain the highest perfection if it is completed, but if one does not attain such a perfectional stage, then he loses both materially and spiritually. It is enjoined in the scriptures that one has to suffer the reaction of not executing prescribed duties; therefore one who fails to discharge transcendental activities properly becomes subjected to these reactions. The Bh\u0101gavatam assures the unsuccessful transcendentalist that there need be no worries. Even though he may be subjected to the reaction of not perfectly executing prescribed duties, he is still not a loser, because auspicious K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is never forgotten, and one so engaged will continue to be so even if he is lowborn in the next life. On the other hand, one who simply follows strictly the prescribed duties need not necessarily attain auspicious results if he is lacking in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u00a0",
      "The purport may be understood as follows: humanity may be divided into two sections, namely, the regulated and the nonregulated. Those who are engaged simply in bestial sense gratifications without knowledge of their next life or spiritual salvation belong to the nonregulated section. And those who follow the principles of prescribed duties in the scriptures are classified amongst the regulated section. The nonregulated section, both civilized and noncivilized, educated and noneducated, strong and weak, are full of animal propensities. Their activities are never auspicious because, enjoying the animal propensities of eating, sleeping, defending and mating, they perpetually remain in material existence, which is always miserable. On the other hand, those who are regulated by scriptural injunctions and thus gradually rise to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness certainly progress in life.\u00a0",
      "Those who are then following the path of auspiciousness can be divided into three sections, namely, 1) the followers of scriptural rules and regulations who are enjoying material prosperity, 2) those who are trying to find out the ultimate liberation from material existence, and 3) those who are devotees in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Those who are following the rules and regulations of the scriptures for material happiness may be further divided into two classes: those who are fruitive workers and those who desire no fruit for sense gratification. Those who are after fruitive results for sense gratification may be elevated to a higher standard of life— even to the higher planets; but still, because they are not free from material existence, they are not following the truly auspicious path. The only auspicious activities are those which lead one to liberation. Any activity which is not aimed at ultimate self-realization or liberation from the material bodily concept of life is not at all auspicious. Activity in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the only auspicious activity, and anyone who voluntarily accepts all bodily discomforts for the sake of making progress on the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness can be called a perfect transcendentalist under severe austerity. And because the eightfold yoga system is directed toward the ultimate realization of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, such practice is also auspicious, and no one who is trying his best in this matter need fear degradation.\u00a0"

      "The word bhajete is significant here. Bhajete has its root in the verb bhaj, which is used when there is need of service. The English word \u201cworship\u201d cannot be used in the same sense as bhaja. Worship means to adore, or to show respect and honor to the worthy one. But service with love and faith is especially meant for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can avoid worshiping a respectable man or a demigod and may be called discourteous, but one cannot avoid serving the Supreme Lord without being thoroughly condemned. Every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus every living entity is intended to serve the Supreme Lord by his own constitution. Failing to do this, he falls down. The Bh\u0101gavatam confirms this as follows:\u00a0",
      "ya eṣāṁ puruṣaṁ sākṣād ātma-prabhavam īśvaram \n na bhajanty avajānanti sthānād bhraṣṭā patanty adhaḥ.",
      "\u201cAnyone who does not render service and neglects his duty unto the Primeval Lord, who is the source of all living entities, will certainly fall down from his constitutional position.\u201d\u00a0",
      "In this verse also the word bhajanti is used. Therefore, bhajanti is applicable to the Supreme Lord only, whereas the word \u201cworship\u201d can be applied to demigods or to any other common living entity. The word avaj\u0101nanti, used in this verse of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, is also found in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: avaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25: \u201cOnly the fools and rascals deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d Such fools take it upon themselves to write commentaries on the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 without an attitude of service to the Lord. Consequently they cannot properly distinguish between the word bhajanti and the word \u201cworship.\u201d\u00a0",
      "The culmination of all kinds of yoga practices lies in bhakti-yoga. All other yogas are but means to come to the point of bhakti in bhakti-yoga. Yoga actually means bhakti-yoga; all other yogas are progressions toward the destination of bhakti-yoga. From the beginning of karma-yoga to the end of bhakti-yoga is a long way to self-realization. Karma-yoga, without fruitive results, is the beginning of this path. When karma-yoga increases in knowledge and renunciation, the stage is called j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga. When j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga increases in meditation on the Supersoul by different physical processes, and the mind is on Him, it is called a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga. And, when one surpasses the a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga and comes to the point of the Supreme Personality of Godhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is called bhakti-yoga, the culmination. Factually, bhakti-yoga is the ultimate goal, but to analyze bhakti-yoga minutely one has to understand these other yogas. The yog\u012b who is progressive is therefore on the true path of eternal good fortune. One who sticks to a particular point and does not make further progress is called by that particular name: karma-yog\u012b, j\u00f1\u0101na-yog\u012b or dhy\u0101na-yog\u012b, r\u0101ja-yog\u012b, ha\u1e6dha-yog\u012b, etc. If one is fortunate enough to come to the point of bhakti-yoga, it is to be understood that he has surpassed all the other yogas. Therefore, to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is the highest stage of yoga, just as, when we speak of Himalayan, we refer to the world\u2019s highest mountains, of which the highest peak, Mount Everest, is considered to be the culmination.\u00a0"

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is full in all opulences, and how He manifests such opulences is described herein.

      "In the first six chapters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the living entity has been described as nonmaterial spirit soul which is capable of elevating himself to self-realization by different types of yogas. At the end of the Sixth Chapter, it has been clearly stated that the steady concentration of the mind upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or in other words K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is the highest form of all yoga. By concentrating one\u2019s mind upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one is able to know the Absolute Truth completely, but not otherwise. Impersonal brahmajyoti or localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 realization is not perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth because it is partial. Full and scientific knowledge is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and everything is revealed to the person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In complete K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one knows that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is ultimate knowledge beyond any doubts. Different types of yoga are only steppingstones on the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One who takes directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness automatically knows about brahmajyoti and Param\u0101tm\u0101 in full. By practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness yoga, one can know everything in full— namely the Absolute Truth, the living entities, the material nature, and their manifestations with paraphernalia.\u00a0",
      "One should therefore begin yoga practice as directed in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter. Concentration of the mind upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the Supreme is made possible by prescribed devotional service in nine different forms, of which \u015brava\u1e47am is the first and most important. The Lord therefore says to Arjuna, \u201ctat \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47u,\u201d or \u201cHear from Me.\u201d No one can be a greater authority than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore by hearing from Him one receives the greatest opportunity for progress in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One has therefore to learn from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly or from a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a— and not from a nondevotee upstart, puffed up with academic education.\u00a0",
      "In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam this process of understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, is described in the Second Chapter of the First Canto as follows:\u00a0",
      "śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāṁ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ \n hṛdyantaḥstho hy abhadrāṇi vidbunoti suhṛt satām.",
      "naṣṭa-prāyeṣv abhadreṣu nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā \n bhagavaty uttama-śloke bhaktir bhavati naiṣṭhikī.",
      "tadā rajas-tamo-bhāvāḥ kāma-lobhadayaś ca ye \n ceta etair anāviddhaṁ sthitaṁ sattve prasīdati.",
      "evam prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ \n bhagavat-tattva-vijñānaṁ mukta-saṅgasya jāyate.",
      "bhidyate hṛdaya-granthiś chidyante sarva-saṁśayāḥ \n kṣīyante cāsya karmāṇi dṛṣṭa evātmanīśvare.",
      "“To hear about Kṛṣṇa from Vedic literatures, or to hear from Him directly through the Bhagavad-gītā, is itself righteous activity. And for one who hears about Kṛṣṇa, Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is dwelling in everyone’s heart, acts as a best-wishing friend and purifies the devotee who constantly engages in hearing of Him. In this way, a devotee naturally develops his dormant transcendental knowledge. As he hears more about Kṛṣṇa from the Bhāgavatam and from the devotees, he becomes fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. By development of devotional service one becomes freed from the modes of passion and ignorance, and thus material lusts and avarice are diminished. When these impurities are wiped away, the candidate remains steady in his position of pure goodness, becomes enlivened by devotional service and understands the science of God perfectly. Thus bhakti-yoga severs the hard knot of material affection and enables one to come at once to the stage of ‘asaṁśayaṁ samagram,’ understanding of the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead.” (Bhāg. 1.2.17-21) "

      "There are various grades of men, and out of many thousands one may be sufficiently interested in transcendental realization to try to know what is the self, what is the body, and what is the Absolute Truth. Generally mankind is simply engaged in the animal propensities, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating, and hardly anyone is interested in transcendental knowledge. The first six chapters of the G\u012bt\u0101 are meant for those who are interested in transcendental knowledge, in understanding the self, the Superself and the process of realization by j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, dhy\u0101na-yoga, and discrimination of the self from matter. However, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can only be known by persons who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Other transcendentalists may achieve impersonal Brahman realization, for this is easier than understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Person, but at the same time He is beyond the knowledge of Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101. The yog\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs are confused in their attempts to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, although the greatest of the impersonalists, \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, has admitted in his G\u012bt\u0101 commentary that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But his followers do not accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as such, for it is very difficult to know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, even though one has transcendental realization of impersonal Brahman.\u00a0",
      "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the primeval Lord Govinda. \u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25 an\u0101dir \u0101dir govinda\u1e25 sarva-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am. It is very difficult for the nondevotees to know Him. Although nondevotees declare that the path of bhakti or devotional service is very easy, they cannot practice it. If the path of bhakti is so easy, as the nondevotee class of men proclaim, then why do they take up the difficult path? Actually the path of bhakti is not easy. The so-called path of bhakti practiced by unauthorized persons without knowledge of bhakti may be easy, but when it is practiced factually according to the rules and regulations, the speculative scholars and philosophers fall away from the path. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b writes in his Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu:\u00a0",

      "\u201cDevotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures like the Upani\u1e63ads, Pur\u0101\u1e47as, N\u0101rada-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra, etc., is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society.\u201d\u00a0",
      "It is not possible for the Brahman realized impersonalist or the Param\u0101tm\u0101 realized yog\u012b to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the son of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 or the charioteer of Arjuna. Even the great demigods are sometimes confused about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: \u201cmuhyanti yat s\u016braya\u1e25,\u201d \u201cm\u0101\u1e41 tu veda na ka\u015bcana.\u201d \u201cNo one knows Me as I am,\u201d the Lord says.

Only the pure devotees can know something of the inconceivable transcendental qualities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in the cause of all causes, in His omnipotence and opulence, and in His wealth, fame, strength, beauty, knowledge and renunciation, because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is benevolently inclined to His devotees. He is the last word in Brahman realization, and the devotees alone can realize Him as He is. Therefore it is said:\u00a0",
      "ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyāiḥ \n sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ",

      "\u201cFor material creation, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s plenary expansion assumes three Vi\u1e63\u1e47us. The first one, Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, creates the total material energy, known as mahat-tattva. The second, Garbhodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, enters into all the universes to create diversities in each of them. The third, K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is diffused as the all-pervading Supersoul in all the universes and is known as Param\u0101tm\u0101, who is present even within the atoms. Anyone who knows these three Vi\u1e63\u1e47us can be liberated from material entanglement.\u201d\u00a0",
      "This material world is a temporary manifestation of one of the energies of the Lord. All the activities of the material world are directed by these three Vi\u1e63\u1e47u expansions of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. These Puru\u1e63as are called incarnations. Generally one who does not know the science of God (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) assumes that this material world is for the enjoyment of the living entities and that the living entities are the causes (Puru\u1e63as), controllers and enjoyers of the material energy. According to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 this atheistic conclusion is false. In the verse under discussion it is stated that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original cause of the material manifestation. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also confirms this. The ingredients of the material manifestation are separated energies of the Lord. Even the brahmajyoti, which is the ultimate goal of the impersonalists, is a spiritual energy manifested in the spiritual sky. There are no spiritual diversities in brahmajyoti as there are in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhalokas, and the impersonalist accepts this brahmajyoti as the ultimate eternal goal. The Param\u0101tm\u0101 manifestation is also a temporary all-pervasive aspect of the K\u1e63\u012brodaka\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The Param\u0101tm\u0101 manifestation is not eternal in the spiritual world. Therefore the factual Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is the complete energetic person, and He possesses different separated and internal energies.\u00a0",
      "In the material energy, the principal manifestations are eight, as above mentioned. Out of these, the first five manifestations, namely earth, water, fire, air and sky, are called the five gigantic creations or the gross creations, within which the five sense objects are included. They are the manifestations of physical sound, touch, form, taste and smell. Material science comprises these ten items and nothing more. But the other three items, namely mind, intelligence and false ego, are neglected by the materialists. Philosophers who deal with mental activities are also not perfect in knowledge because they do not know the ultimate source, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The false ego— \u201cI am,\u201d and \u201cIt is mine,\u201d which constitute the basic principle of material existence— includes ten sense organs for material activities. Intelligence refers to the total material creation, called the mahat-tattva. Therefore from the eight separated energies of the Lord are manifest the twenty-four elements of the material world, which are the subject matter of s\u0101\u1e45khya atheistic philosophy; they are originally offshoots from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energies and are separated from Him, but atheistic s\u0101\u1e45khya philosophers with a poor fund of knowledge do not know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the cause of all causes. The subject matter for discussion in the s\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy is only the manifestation of the external energy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as it is described in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\u00a0"

The living entities, who are exploiting these inferior energies for different purposes, are the superior energy of the Supreme Lord, and it is due to this energy that the entire material world functions. The cosmic manifestation has no power to act unless it is moved by the superior energy, the living entity. Energies are always controlled by the energetic, and therefore living entities are always controlled by the Lord-they have no independant existence. They are never equally powerful, as unintelligent men think. The distinction between the living entities and the Lord is described in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam as follows (10.87.30):\u00a0",

These living entities are His superior energy because the quality of their existence is one and the same with the Supreme, but they are never equal to the Lord in quantity of power. While exploiting the gross and subtle inferior energy (matter), the superior energy (the living entity) forgets his real spiritual mind and intelligence. This forgetfulness is due to the influence of matter upon the living entity. But when the living entity becomes free from the influence of the illusory material energy, he attains the stage called mukti, or liberation. The false ego, under the influence of material illusion, thinks, \u201cI am matter, and material acquisitions are mine.\u201d His actual position is realized when he is liberated from all material ideas, including the conception of his becoming one in all respects with God. Therefore one may conclude that the G\u012bt\u0101 confirms the living entity to be only one of the multi-energies of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; and when this energy is freed from material contamination, it becomes fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, or liberated.\u00a0"

      "Everything that exists is a product of matter and spirit. Spirit is the basic field of creation, and matter is created by spirit. Spirit is not created at a certain stage of material development. Rather, this material world is manifested only on the basis of spiritual energy. This material body is developed because spirit is present within matter; a child grows gradually to boyhood and then to manhood because of that superior energy, spirit soul, being present. Similarly, the entire cosmic manifestation of the gigantic universe is developed because of the presence of the Supersoul, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Therefore spirit and matter, which combine together to manifest this gigantic universal form, are originally two energies of the Lord, and consequently the Lord is the original cause of everything. A fragmental part and parcel of the Lord, namely, the living entity, may by manipulation of material energy construct a skyscraper, factory or city, but he cannot create matter out of nothing, and he certainly cannot construct a planet or a universe. The cause of the universe is the Supersoul, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme creator of all individual souls and the original cause of all causes, as the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad confirms: nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m.\u00a0"

      "There is a common controversy over whether the Supreme Absolute Truth is personal or impersonal. As far as Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is concerned, the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and this is confirmed in every step. In this verse, in particular, it is stressed that the Absolute Truth is a person. That the Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Absolute Truth is also the affirmation of the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101: \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25; that is, the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the primeval Lord, the reservoir of all pleasure, Govinda, and the eternal form of complete bliss and knowledge. These authorities leave no doubt that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person, the cause of all causes. The impersonalist, however, argues on the strength of the Vedic version given in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad: tato yad uttaratara\u1e41 tad ar\u016bpam an\u0101maya\u1e41 ya etad vidur am\u1e5bt\u0101s te bhavanti athetare du\u1e25kham ev\u0101pi yanti. \u201cIn the material world Brahm\u0101, the primeval living entity within the universe, is understood to be the supreme amongst the demigods, human beings and lower animals. But beyond Brahm\u0101 there is the Transcendence who has no material form and is free from all material contaminations. Anyone who can know Him also becomes transcendental, but those who do not know Him suffer the miseries of the material world.\u201d\u00a0",
      "The impersonalist puts more stress on the word ar\u016bpam. But this ar\u016bpam is not impersonal. It indicates the transcendental form of eternity, bliss and knowledge as described in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 quoted above. Other verses in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad substantiate this as follows:\u00a0",

      "This verse explains how the Lord is all-pervasive by His diverse material and spiritual energies. The Supreme Lord can be preliminarily perceived by His different energies, and in this way He is realized impersonally. As the demigod in the sun is a person and is perceived by his all-pervading energy, the sunshine, similarly, the Lord, although in His eternal abode, is perceived by His all-pervading, diffusive energies. The taste of water is the active principle of water. No one likes to drink sea water because the pure taste of water is mixed with salt. Attraction for water depends on the purity of the taste, and this pure taste is one of the energies of the Lord. The impersonalist perceives the presence of the Lord in water by its taste, and the personalist also glorifies the Lord for His kindly supplying water to quench man\u2019s thirst. That is the way of perceiving the Supreme. Practically speaking, there is no conflict between personalism and impersonalism. One who knows God knows that the impersonal conception and personal conception are simultaneously present in everything and that there is no contradiction. Therefore Lord Caitanya established His sublime doctrine: acintya-bheda and abheda-tattvam-simultaneously one and different.\u00a0",
      "The light of the sun and the moon is also originally emanating from the brahmajyoti, which is the impersonal effulgence of the Lord. Similarly pra\u1e47ava or the omk\u0101ra transcendental sound used in the beginning of every Vedic hymn to address the Supreme Lord also emanates from Him. Because the impersonalists are very much afraid of addressing the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by His innumerable names, they prefer to vibrate the transcendental sound omk\u0101ra. But they do not realize that omk\u0101ra is the sound representation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The jurisdiction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness extends everywhere, and one who knows K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is blessed. Those who do not know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are in illusion, and so knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is liberation, and ignorance of Him is bondage.\u00a0"

      "The Supreme Personality of Godhead has innumerable energies, and all these energies are divine. Although the living entities are part of His energies and are therefore divine, due to contact with material energy, their original superior power is covered. Being thus covered by material energy, one cannot possibly overcome its influence. As previously stated, both the material and spiritual natures, being emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are eternal. The living entities belong to the eternal superior nature of the Lord, but due to contamination by the inferior nature, matter, their illusion is also eternal. The conditioned soul is therefore called nitya-baddha, or eternally conditioned. No one can trace out the history of his becoming conditioned at a certain date in material history. Consequently, his release from the clutches of material nature is very difficult, even though that material nature is an inferior energy, because material energy is ultimately conducted by the supreme will, which the living entity cannot overcome. Inferior material nature is defined herein as divine nature due to its divine connection and movement by the divine will. Being conducted by divine will, material nature, although inferior, acts so wonderfully in the construction and destruction of the cosmic manifestation. The Vedas confirm this as follows:\u00a0",
      "māyāṁ tu prakṛtiṁ vidyān māyinaṁ tu maheśvaram.",
      "\u201cAlthough m\u0101y\u0101 [illusion] is false or temporary, the background of m\u0101y\u0101 is the supreme magician, the Personality of Godhead, who is Mahe\u015bvara, the supreme controller.\u201d\u00a0",
      "Another meaning of gu\u1e47a is rope; it is to be understood that the conditioned soul is tightly tied by the ropes of illusion. A man bound by the hands and feet cannot free himself— he must be helped by a person who is unbound. Because the bound cannot help the bound, the rescuer must be liberated. Therefore, only Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or His bona fide representative the spiritual master, can release the conditioned soul. Without such superior help, one cannot be freed from the bondage of material nature. Devotional service, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, can help one gain such release. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being the Lord of illusory energy, can order this insurmountable energy to release the conditioned soul. He orders this release out of His causeless mercy on the surrendered soul and out of His paternal affection for the living entity who is originally a beloved son of the Lord. Therefore surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord is the only means to get free from the clutches of the stringent material nature.\u00a0",
      "The words m\u0101m eva are also significant. M\u0101m means unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u) only, and not Brahm\u0101 or \u015aiva. Although Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva are greatly elevated and are almost on the level of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, it is not possible for such incarnations of r\u0101jo-gu\u1e47a (passion) and tamo-gu\u1e47a (ignorance) to release the conditioned soul from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101. In other words, both Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva are also under the influence of m\u0101y\u0101. Only Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the master of m\u0101y\u0101; therefore He can alone give release to the conditioned soul. The Vedas confirm this in the phrase tvam eva viditv\u0101 or \u201cFreedom is possible only by understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d Even Lord \u015aiva affirms that liberation can be achieved only by the mercy of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.

      "It is said in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that simply by surrendering oneself unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one can surmount the stringent laws of material nature. At this point a question arises: How is it that educated philosophers, scientists, businessmen, administrators and all the leaders of ordinary men do not surrender to the lotus feet of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the all-powerful Personality of Godhead? Mukti, or liberation from the laws of material nature, is sought by the leaders of mankind in different ways and with great plans and perseverance for a great many years and births. But if that liberation is possible by simply surrendering unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then why don\u2019t these intelligent and hard-working leaders adopt this simple method?\u00a0",
      "The G\u012bt\u0101 answers this question very frankly. Those really learned leaders of society like Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva, Kapila, the Kum\u0101ras, Manu, Vy\u0101sa, Devala, Asita, Janaka, Prahl\u0101da, Bali, and later on Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya, R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya and many others-who are faithful philosophers, politicians, educators, scientists, etc.-surrender to the lotus feet of the Supreme Person, the all-powerful authority. Those who are not actually philosophers, scientists, educators, administrators, etc., but who pose themselves as such for material gain, do not accept the plan or path of the Supreme Lord. They have no idea of God; they simply manufacture their own worldly plans and consequently complicate the problems of material existence in their vain attempts to solve them. Because material energy (nature) is so powerful, it can resist the unauthorized plans of the atheists and baffle the knowledge of \u201cplanning commissions.\u201d\u00a0",
      "The atheistic plan-makers are described herein by the word du\u1e63k\u1e5btina, or \u201cmiscreants.\u201d K\u1e5btina means one who has performed meritorious work. The atheist planmaker is sometimes very intelligent and meritorious also, because any gigantic plan, good or bad, must take intelligence to execute. But because the atheist\u2019s brain is improperly utilized in opposing the plan of the Supreme Lord, the atheistic planmaker is called du\u1e63k\u1e5btina, which indicates that his intelligence and efforts are misdirected.\u00a0",
      "In the G\u012bt\u0101 it is clearly mentioned that material energy works fully under the direction of the Supreme Lord. It has no independant authority. It works as the shadow moves, in accordance with the movements of the object. But still material energy is very powerful, and the atheist, due to his godless temperament, cannot know how it works; nor can he know the plan of the Supreme Lord. Under illusion and the modes of passion and ignorance, all his plans are baffled, as in the case of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu and R\u0101va\u1e47a, whose plans were smashed to dust although they were both materially learned as scientists, philosophers, administrators and educators. These du\u1e63k\u1e5btinas, or miscreants, are of four different patterns, as outlined below:\u00a0"

      "\u201cOne should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.\u201d\u00a0",
      "When these four kinds of persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service and are completely purified by the association of a pure devotee, they also become pure devotees. As far as the miscreants are concerned, for them devotional service is very difficult because their lives are selfish, irregular and without spiritual goals. But even some of them, by chance, when they come in contact with a pure devotee, also become pure devotees.\u00a0",
      "Those who are always busy with fruitive activities come to the Lord in material distress and at that time associate with pure devotees and become, in their distress, devotees of the Lord. Those who are simply frustrated also come sometimes to associate with the pure devotees and become inquisitive to know about God. Similarly, when the dry philosophers are frustrated in every field of knowledge, they sometimes want to learn of God, and they come to the Supreme Lord to render devotional service and thus transcend knowledge of the impersonal Brahman and the localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 and come to the personal conception of Godhead by the grace of the Supreme Lord or His pure devotee. On the whole, when the distressed, the inquisitive, the seekers of knowledge, and those who are in need of money are free from all material desires, and when they fully understand that material remuneration has nothing to do with spiritual improvement, they become pure devotees. As long as such a purified stage is not attained, devotees in transcendental service to the Lord are tainted with fruitive activities, and they search after mundane knowledge, etc. So one has to transcend all this before one can come to the stage of pure devotional service.\u00a0"

      "The living entity, while executing devotional service or transcendental rituals after many, many births, may actually become situated in transcendental pure knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of spiritual realization. In the beginning of spiritual realization, while one is trying to give up one\u2019s attachment to materialism, there is some leaning towards impersonalism, but when one is further advanced he can understand that there are activities in the spiritual life and that these activities constitute devotional service. Realizing this, he becomes attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrenders to Him.

He realizes the material world to be a perverted reflection of spiritual variegatedness and realizes that in everything there is a relationship with the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus he thinks of everything in relation to V\u0101sudeva, or \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

Following the rules and regulations of worship, they are satisfied. The worshipers of demigods are motivated by small desires and do not know how to reach the supreme goal, but a devotee of the Supreme Lord is not misguided. Because in Vedic literature there are recommendations for worshiping different gods for different purposes (e.g., a diseased man is recommended to worship the sun), those who are not devotees of the Lord think that for certain purposes demigods are better than the Supreme Lord. But a pure devotee knows that the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the master of all. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta it is said that only the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is master and all others are servants.

But the pure devotee, when in need of something, prays only to the Supreme Lord. Asking for material benefit, however, is not a sign of a pure devotee. A living entity goes to the demigods usually because he is mad to fulfill his lust. This happens when something undue is desired by the living entity, and the Lord Himself does not fulfill the desire. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta it is said that one who worships the Supreme Lord and at the same time desires material enjoyment is contradictory in his desires. Devotional service of the Supreme Lord and the worship of a demigod cannot be on the same platform because worship of a demigod is material and devotional service to the Supreme Lord is completely spiritual.\u00a0",
      "For the living entity who desires to return to Godhead, material desires are impediments. A pure devotee of the Lord is therefore not awarded the material benefits desired by less intelligent living entities who prefer to worship demigods of the material world rather than engage in devotional service of the Supreme Lord.\u00a0"

      "Some commentators on the G\u012bt\u0101 say that one who worships a demigod can reach the Supreme Lord, but here it is clearly stated that the worshipers of demigods go to the different planetary systems where various demigods are situated, just as a worshiper of the sun achieves the sun or a worshiper of the demigod of the moon achieves the moon. Similarly, if anyone wants to worship a demigod like Indra, he can attain that particular god\u2019s planet. It is not that everyone, regardless of whatever demigod is worshiped, will reach the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is denied here, for it is clearly stated that the worshipers of demigods go to different planets in the material world, but the devotee of the Supreme Lord goes directly to the supreme planet of the Personality of Godhead.\u00a0",
      "Here the point may be raised that if the demigods are different parts of the body of the Supreme Lord, then the same end should be achieved by worshiping them. However, worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent because they don\u2019t know to what part of the body food must be supplied. Some of them are so foolish that they claim that there are many parts and many ways to supply food. This isn\u2019t very sanguine. Can anyone supply food to the body through the ears or eyes? They do not know that these demigods are different parts of the universal body of the Supreme Lord, and in their ignorance they believe that each and every demigod is a separate God and a competitor of the Supreme Lord.\u00a0",
      "Not only are demigods parts of the Supreme Lord, but ordinary living entities are also. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that the br\u0101hma\u1e47as are the head of the Supreme Lord, the k\u1e63atriyas are the arms, etc., and that all serve different functions. Regardless of the situation, if one knows that both the demigods and himself are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, his knowledge is perfect. But if he does not understand this, he achieves different planets where the demigods reside. This is not the same destination the devotee reaches.\u00a0",
      "The results achieved by the demigods\u2019 benedictions are perishable because within this material world the planets, the demigods and their worshipers are all perishable. Therefore it is clearly stated in this verse that all results achieved by worshiping demigods are perishable, and therefore such worship is performed by the less intelligent living entity. Because the pure devotee engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in devotional service of the Supreme Lord achieves eternal blissful existence that is full of knowledge, his achievements and those of the common worshiper of the demigods are different. The Supreme Lord is unlimited; His favor is unlimited; His mercy is unlimited. Therefore the mercy of the Supreme Lord upon His pure devotees is unlimited.\u00a0"

      "Those who are worshipers of demigods have been described as less intelligent persons, and here the impersonalists are similarly described. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His personal form is here speaking before Arjuna, and still, due to ignorance, impersonalists argue that the Supreme Lord ultimately has no form. Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya, a great devotee of the Lord in the disciplic succession from R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya, has written two very appropriate verses in this connection. He says, \u201cMy dear Lord, devotees like Vy\u0101sadeva and N\u0101rada know You to be the Personality of Godhead. By understanding different Vedic literatures, one can come to know Your characteristics, Your form and Your activities, and one can thus understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance, the demons, the nondevotees, cannot understand You. They are unable to understand You. However expert such nondevotees may be in discussing Ved\u0101nta and the Upani\u1e63ads and other Vedic literatures, it is not possible for them to understand the Personality of Godhead.\u201d\u00a0",
      "In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is stated that the Personality of Godhead cannot be understood simply by study of the Ved\u0101nta literature. Only by the mercy of the Supreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme be known. Therefore in this verse it is clearly stated that not only the worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent, but those nondevotees who are engaged in Ved\u0101nta and speculation on Vedic literature without any tinge of true K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are also less intelligent, and for them it is not possible to understand God\u2019s personal nature. Persons who are under the impression that the Absolute Truth is impersonal are described as asuras, which means one who does not know the ultimate feature of the Absolute Truth. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that supreme realization begins from the impersonal Brahman and then rises to the localized Supersoul-but the ultimate word in the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead. Modern impersonalists are still less intelligent, for they do not even follow their great predecessor, \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, who has specifically stated that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Impersonalists, therefore, not knowing the Supreme Truth, think K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be only the son of Devak\u012b and Vasudeva, or a prince, or a powerful living entity. This is also condemned in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: \u201cOnly the fools regard Me as an ordinary person.\u201d The fact is that no one can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without rendering devotional service and without developing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The G\u012bt\u0101 confirms this.\u00a0",
      "One cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or His form, quality or name simply by mental speculation or by discussing Vedic literature. One must understand Him by devotional service. When one is fully engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, beginning by chanting the mah\u0101mantra-Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare-then only can one understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nondevotee impersonalists think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has a body made of this material nature and that all His activities, His form and everything, are m\u0101y\u0101. These impersonalists are known as M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b. They do not know the ultimate truth.\u00a0",
      "The twentieth verse clearly states: \u201cThose who are blinded by lusty desires surrender unto the different demigods.\u201d It is accepted that besides the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there are demigods who have their different planets (Bg. 7.23)As It Is 7.23Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods, but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet., and the Lord also has a planet. It is also stated that the worshipers of the demigods go to the different planets of the demigods, and those who are devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a go to the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka planet. Although this is clearly stated, the foolish impersonalists still maintain that the Lord is formless and that these forms are impositions. From the study of the G\u012bt\u0101 does it appear that the demigods and their abodes are impersonal? Clearly, neither the demigods nor K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are impersonal. They are all persons; Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He has His own planet, and the demigods have theirs.\u00a0"

If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is considered by the impersonalists to be m\u0101y\u0101, to be material, then He would, like the living entity, change His body and forget everything in His past life. Anyone with a material body cannot remember his past life, nor can he foretell his future life, nor can he predict the outcome of his present life; therefore he cannot know what is happening in past, present and future. Unless one is liberated from material contamination, he cannot know past, present and future.\u00a0",
      "Unlike the ordinary human being, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly says that He completely knows what happened in the past, what is happening in the present, and what will happen in the future. In the Fourth Chapter we have seen that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a remembers instructing Vivasv\u0101n, the sun-god, millions of years ago. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a knows every living entity because He is situated in every living being\u2019s heart as the Supreme Soul. But despite His presence in every living entity as Supersoul and His presence beyond the material sky, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the less intelligent cannot realize Him as the Supreme Person. Certainly the transcendental body of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not perishable. He is just like the sun, and may\u0101 is like the cloud. In the material world we can see that there is the sun and that there are clouds and different stars and planets. The clouds may cover all these in the sky temporarily, but this covering is only apparent to our limited vision. The sun, moon and stars are not actually covered. Similarly, m\u0101y\u0101 cannot cover the Supreme Lord. By His internal potency He is not manifest to the less intelligent class of men.

In such a situation he takes pleasure in hearing and glorifying the Supreme Lord in pure devotional service. He is convinced that by doing so, all his objectives will be fulfilled. This determined faith is called d\u1e5b\u1e0dha-vrata, and it is the beginning of bhakti-yoga or transcendental loving service. That is the verdict of all scriptures.

Therefore Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Kula\u015bekhara, a great devotee, prays, \u201cMy dear Lord, may I die immediately now that I\u2019m healthy so that the swan of my mind may enter into the stem of Thy lotus feet.\u201d This metaphor is used because the swan often takes pleasure in entering the stem of the lotus flower-similarly, the mind of the pure devotee is drawn to the lotus feet of the Lord. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Kula\u015bekhara fears that at the moment of death his throat will be so choked up that he will not be able to chant the holy names, so it is better to \u201cdie immediately.\u201d Arjuna questions how one\u2019s mind can remain fixed on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet at such times.\u00a0"

      "Brahman is indestructible and eternally existing, and its constitution is not changed at any time. But beyond Brahman there is Parabrahman. Brahman refers to the living entity, and Parabrahman refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The constitutional position of the living entity is different from the position he takes in the material world. In material consciousness, his nature is to try to be the lord of matter, but in spiritual (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) consciousness, his position is to serve the Supreme. When the living entity is in material consciousness, he has to take on various bodies in the material world. That is called karma, or varied creation by the force of material consciousness.\u00a0",
      "In Vedic literature the living entity is called j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101 and Brahman, but he is never called Parabrahman. The living entity (j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101) takes different positions— sometimes he merges into the dark material nature and identifies himself with matter, and sometimes he identifies himself with the superior spiritual nature. Therefore he is called the Supreme Lord\u2019s marginal energy. According to his identification with material or spiritual nature, he receives a material or spiritual body. In material nature he may take a body from any of the 8,400,000 species of life, but in spiritual nature he has only one body. In material nature he is sometimes manifested as a man, demigod, an animal, a beast, bird, etc., according to his karma. To attain material heavenly planets and enjoy their facilities, he sometimes performs sacrifices (yaj\u00f1a), but when his merit is exhausted, he returns to earth again in the form of a man.\u00a0",
      "In the process of sacrifice, the living entity makes specific sacrifices to attain specific heavenly planets and consequently reaches them. When the merit of sacrifice is exhausted, then the living entity descends to earth in the form of rain, then takes on the form of grains, and the grains are eaten by man and transformed into semen, which impregnates a woman, and thus the living entity once again attains the human form to perform sacrifice and so repeat the same cycle. In this way, the living entity perpetually comes and goes on the material path. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, however, avoids such sacrifices. He takes directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and thereby prepares himself to return to Godhead.\u00a0",
      "Impersonalist commentators on the G\u012bt\u0101 unreasonably assume that Brahman takes the form of j\u012bva in the material world, and to substantiate this they refer to Chapter Fifteen, verse 7, of the G\u012bt\u0101. But this verse also speaks of the living entity as \u201can eternal fragment of Myself.\u201d The fragment of God, the living entity, may fall down into the material world, but the Supreme Lord (Acyuta) never falls down. Therefore this assumption that the Supreme Brahman assumes the form of j\u012bva is not acceptable. It is important to remember that in Vedic literature Brahman (the living entity) is distinguished from Parabrahman (the Supreme Lord).\u00a0"

      "The physical nature is constantly changing. Material bodies generally pass through six stages: they are born, they grow, they remain for some duration, they produce some by-products, they dwindle, and then they vanish. This physical nature is called adhibh\u016btam. Because it is created at a certain point and will be annihilated at a certain point, the conception of the universal form of the Supreme Lord that includes all the demigods and their different planets is called adhidaivatam. The individual soul (j\u012bva) accompanies the body. The Supersoul, a plenary representation of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is called the Param\u0101tm\u0101 or adhiyaj\u00f1a and is situated in the heart. The word eva is particularly important in the context of this verse because by this word the Lord stresses that the Param\u0101tm\u0101 is not different from Him. The Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, seated beside the individual soul, is the witness of the individual soul\u2019s activities and is the source of consciousness. The Supersoul gives the j\u012bva an opportunity to act freely, and He witnesses his activities. The functions of all these different manifestations of the Supreme Lord automatically become clarified for the pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious devotee engaged in transcendental service of the Lord. The gigantic universal form of the Lord called adhidaivatam is contemplated by the neophyte who cannot approach the Supreme Lord in His manifestation as Supersoul. The neophyte is advised to contemplate the universal form whose legs are considered the lowet planets and whose eyes are considered the sun and moon, and whose head is considered the upper planetary system.\u00a0"

Although living entities belong to the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord, they are in material contamination. They think themselves enjoyers, but they are not the supreme enjoyer. Here it is clearly stated that the supreme enjoyer is the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His different manifestations and plenary expansions as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, V\u0101sudeva, etc.\u00a0",

One example often given is that of the caterpillar that thinks of becoming a butterfly and so is transformed into a butterfly in the same life. Similarly, if we constantly think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is certain that at the end of our lives we shall have the same bodily constitution as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u00a0"

      "The process of thinking of the Supreme is mentioned in this verse. The foremost point is that He is not impersonal or void. One cannot meditate on something impersonal or void. That is very difficult. The process of thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, is very easy and is factually stated herein. First of all, He is puru\u1e63a, spiritual, R\u0101ma and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and is described herein as kavim; that is, He knows past, present and future and therefore knows everything. He is the oldest personality because He is the origin of everything; everything is born out of Him. He is also the supreme controller of the universe, maintainer and instructor of humanity. He is smaller than the smallest. The living entity is one 10,000th part of the tip of a hair, but the Lord is so inconceivably small that He enters into the heart of this particle. Therefore He is called smaller than the smallest. As the Supreme, He can enter into the atom and into the heart of the smallest and control him as the Supersoul. Although so small, He is still all-pervading and is maintaining everything. By Him all these planetary systems are sustained. We often wonder how these big planets are floating in the air. It is stated here that the Supreme Lord, by His inconceivable energy, is sustaining all these big planets and systems of galaxies. The word acintya (inconceivable) is very significant in this connection. God\u2019s energy is beyond our conception, beyond our thinking jurisdiction, and is therefore called inconceivable (acintya). Who can argue this point? He pervades this material world and yet is beyond it. We cannot even comprehend this material world, which is insignificant compared to the spiritual world-so how can we comprehend what is beyond? Acintya means that which is beyond this material world, that which our argument, logic and philosophical speculation cannot touch, that which is inconceivable. Therefore intelligent persons, avoiding useless argument and speculation, should accept what is stated in scriptures like the Vedas, G\u012bt\u0101, and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and follow the principles they set down. This will lead one to understanding.\u00a0"

In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta the pure devotee is called ni\u1e63k\u0101ma, which means he has no desire for self-interest. Perfect peace belongs to him alone, not to them who strive for personal gain. The pure devotee only wants to please the Supreme Lord, and so the Lord says that for anyone who is unflinchingly devoted to Him, He is easy to attain. The devotee can render service to any of the transcendental forms of the Supreme Lord, and he meets with none of the problems that plague the practitioners of other yogas. Bhakti-yoga is very simple and pure and easy to perform. One can begin by simply chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very merciful to those who engage in His service, and He helps in various ways that devotee who is fully surrendered to Him so he can understand Him as He is. The Lord gives such a devotee sufficient intelligence so that ultimately the devotee can attain Him in His spiritual kingdom.\u00a0",
      "The special qualification of the pure devotee is that he is always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without considering the time or place. There should be no impediments. He should be able to carry out his service anywhere and at any time. Some say that the devotee should remain in holy places like V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana or some holy town where the Lord lived, but a pure devotee can live anywhere and create the atmosphere of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana by his devotional service. It was \u015ar\u012b Advaita who told Lord Caitanya, \u201cWherever You are, O Lord-there is V\u1e5bndavana.\u201d\u00a0",
      "A pure devotee constantly remembers K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and meditates upon Him. These are qualifications of the pure devotee for whom the Lord is most easily attainable. Bhakti-yoga is the system that the G\u012bt\u0101 recommends above all others. Generally, the bhakti-yog\u012bs are engaged in five different ways: 1) \u015b\u0101nta-bhakta, engaged in devotional service in neutrality; 2) d\u0101sya-bhakta, engaged in devotional service as servant; 3) s\u0101khya-bhakta, engaged as friend; 4) v\u0101tsalya-bhakta, engaged as parent; and 5) m\u0101dhurya-bhakta, engaged as conjugal lover of the Supreme Lord. In any of these ways, the pure devotee is always constantly engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord and cannot forget the Supreme Lord, and so for him the Lord is easily attained. A pure devotee cannot forget the Supreme Lord for a moment, and similarly, the Supreme Lord cannot forget His pure devotee for a moment. This is the great blessing of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious process of chanting the mah\u0101mantra, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u00a0"

A kalpa is a day of Brahm\u0101, and one day of Brahm\u0101 consists of a thousand cycles of four yugas or ages: Satya, Tret\u0101, Dv\u0101para, and Kali. The cycle of Satya is characterized by virtue, wisdom and religion, there being practically no ignorance and vice, and the yuga lasts 1,728,000 years. In the Tret\u0101-yuga vice is introduced, and this yuga lasts 1,296,000 years. In the Dv\u0101para-yuga there is an even greater decline in virtue and religion, vice increasing, and this yuga lasts 864,000 years. And finally in Kali-yuga (the yuga we have now been experiencing over the past 5,000 years) there is an abundance of strife, ignorance, irreligion and vice, true virtue being practically nonexistent, and this yuga lasts 432,000 years. In Kali-yuga vice increases to such a point that at the termination of the yuga the Supreme Lord Himself appears as the Kalki avatara, vanquishes the demons, saves His devotees, and commences another Satya-yuga. Then the process is set rolling again. These four yugas, rotating a thousand times, comprise one day of Brahm\u0101, the creator god, and the same number comprise one night. Brahm\u0101 lives one hundred of such \u201cyears\u201d and then dies. These \u201chundred years\u201d by earth calculations total to 311 trillion and 40 million earth years. By these calculations the life of Brahm\u0101 seems fantastic and interminable, but from the viewpoint of eternity it is as brief as a lightning flash.

      "The supreme abode of the Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is described in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 as cint\u0101ma\u1e47i-dh\u0101ma, a place where all desires are fulfilled. The supreme abode of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a known as Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana is full of palaces made of touchstone. There are also trees which are called \u201cdesire trees\u201d that supply any type of eatable upon demand, and there are cows known as surabhi cows which supply a limitless supply of milk. In this abode, the Lord is served by hundreds of thousands of goddesses of fortune (Lak\u1e63m\u012bs), and He is called Govinda, the primal Lord and the cause of all causes. The Lord is accustomed to blow His flute (venum kvanantam). His transcendental form is the most attractive in all the worlds— His eyes are like the lotus petals and the color of His body like clouds. He is so attractive that His beauty excels that of thousands of cupids. He wears saffron cloth, a garland around His neck and a peacock feather in His hair. In the G\u012bt\u0101 Lord Kr\u1e63\u1e47a gives only a small hint of His personal abode (Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana) which is the supermost planet in the spiritual kingdom. A vivid description is given in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. Vedic literature states that there is nothing superior to the abode of the Supreme Godhead, and that that abode is the ultimate destination. When one attains to it, he never returns to the material world. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s supreme abode and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself are nondifferent, being of the same quality. On this earth, V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, ninety miles southeast of Delhi, is a replica of that supreme Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana located in the spiritual sky. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descended on this earth, He sported on that particular tract of land known as V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana in the district of Mathur\u0101, India.\u00a0"

      "This verse is the summation of the Seventh and Eighth Chapters, particularly as the chapters deal with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and devotional service. One has to study the Vedas under the guidance of the spiritual master and undergo many austerities and penances while living under his care. A brahmac\u0101r\u012b has to live in the home of the spiritual master just like a servant, and he must beg alms from door to door and bring them to the spiritual master. He takes food only under the master\u2019s order, and if the master neglects to call the student for food that day, the student fasts. These are some of the Vedic principles for observing brahmacarya.\u00a0",
      "After the student studies the Vedas under the master for a period from five to twenty years, he may become a man of perfect character. Study of the Vedas is not meant for the recreation of armchair speculators, but for the formation of character. After this training, the brahmac\u0101r\u012b is allowed to enter into household life and marry. When he is a householder, he also has to perform many sacrifices and strive for further enlightenment. Then after retiring from household life, upon accepting the order of v\u0101naprastha, he undergoes severe penances, such as living in forests, dressing with tree bark, not shaving, etc. By carrying out the orders of brahmac\u0101r\u012b, householder, v\u0101naprastha and finally sanny\u0101sa, one becomes elevated to the perfectional stage of life. Some are then elevated to the heavenly kingdoms, and when they become even more advanced they are liberated in the spiritual sky, either in the impersonal brahmajyoti or in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka. This is the path outlined by Vedic literatures.\u00a0",
      "The beauty of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, is that by one stroke, by engaging in devotional service, one can surpass all rituals of the different orders of life.\u00a0",
      "One should try to understand the Seventh and Eighth Chapters of the G\u012bt\u0101 not by scholarship or mental speculation, but by hearing them in association with pure devotees. Chapters Six through Twelve are the essence of the G\u012bt\u0101. If one is fortunate to understand the G\u012bt\u0101— especially these middle six chapters— in the association of devotees, then his life at once becomes glorified beyond all penances, sacrifices, charities, speculations, etc. One should hear the G\u012bt\u0101 from the devotee because at the beginning of the Fourth Chapter it is stated that the G\u012bta can only be perfectly understood by devotees. Hearing the G\u012bt\u0101 from devotees, not from mental speculators, is called faith. Through association of devotees, one is placed in devotional service, and by this service K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s activities, form, pastimes, name, etc., become clear, and all misgivings are dispelled. Then once doubts are removed, the study of the G\u012bt\u0101 becomes extremely pleasurable, and one develops a taste and feeling for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In the advanced stage, one falls completely in love with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that is the beginning of the highest perfectional stage of life which prepares the devotee\u2019s transferral to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s abode in the spiritual sky, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, where the devotee enters into eternal happiness.\u00a0"

      "As a devotee hears more and more about the Supreme Lord, he becomes enlightened. This hearing process is recommended in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam: \u201cThe messages of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are full of potencies, and these potencies can be realized if topics regarding the Supreme Godhead are discussed amongst devotees. This cannot be achieved by the association of mental speculators or academic scholars, for it is realized knowledge.\u201d\u00a0",
      "The devotees are constantly engaged in the Supreme Lord\u2019s service. The Lord understands the mentality and sincerity of a particular living entity who is engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and gives him the intelligence to understand the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the association of the devotees. Discussion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very potent, and if a fortunate person has such association and tries to assimilate the knowledge, then he will surely make advancement toward spiritual realization. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in order to encourage Arjuna to higher and higher elevation in His potent service, describes in this Ninth Chapter matters more confidential than any He has already disclosed.\u00a0",
      "The very beginning of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the First Chapter, is more or less an introduction to the rest of the book; and in the Second and Third Chapters, the spiritual knowledge described is called confidential. Topics discussed in the Seventh and Eighth Chapters are specifically related to devotional service, and because they bring enlightenment in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, they are called more confidential. But the matters which are described in the Ninth Chapter deal with unalloyed, pure devotion. Therefore this is called the most confidential. One who is situated in the most confidential knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is naturally transcendental; he therefore has no material pangs, although he is in the material world. In the Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu it is said that although one who has a sincere desire to render loving service to the Supreme Lord is situated in the conditional state of material existence, he is to be considered liberated. Similarly, we shall find in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Tenth Chapter, that anyone who is engaged in that way is a liberated person.\u00a0",
      "Now this first verse has specific significance. Knowledge (ida\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101nam) refers to pure devotional service, which consists of nine different activities: hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping, praying, obeying, maintaining friendship and surrendering everything. By the practice of these nine elements of devotional service one is elevated to spiritual consciousness, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. At the time when one\u2019s heart is cleared of the material contamination, one can understand this science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Simply to understand that a living entity is not material is not sufficient. That may be the beginning of spiritual realization, but one should recognize the difference between activities of the body and spiritual activities by which one understands that he is not the body.\u00a0"

  "purport": [
      "This chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is called the king of education because it is the essence of all doctrines and philosophies explained before. There are seven principal philosophers in India: Gautama, Ka\u1e47\u0101da, Kapila, Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya, \u015a\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dilya, Vai\u015bv\u0101nara, and, finally, Vy\u0101sadeva, the author of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra. So there is no dearth of knowledge in the field of philosophy or transcendental knowledge. Now the Lord says that this Ninth Chapter is the king of all such knowledge, the essence of all knowledge that can be derived from the study of the Vedas and different kinds of philosophy. It is the most confidential because confidential or transcendental knowledge involves understanding the difference between the soul and the body. And the king of all confidential knowledge culminates in devotional service.\u00a0",
      "Generally, people are not educated in this confidential knowledge; they are educated in external knowledge. As far as ordinary education is concerned, people are involved with so many departments: politics, sociology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, astronomy, engineering, etc. There are so many departments of knowledge all over the world and many huge universities, but there is, unfortunately, no university or educational institution where the science of the spirit soul is instructed. Yet the soul is the most important part of this body; without the presence of the soul, the body has no value. Still people are placing great stress on the bodily necessities of life, not caring for the vital soul.\u00a0",
      "The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, especially from the Second Chapter on, stresses the importance of the soul. In the very beginning, the Lord says that this body is perishable and that the soul is not perishable. That is a confidential part of knowledge: simply knowing that spirit soul is different from this body and that its nature is immutable, indestructible and eternal. But that gives no positive information about the soul. Sometimes people are under the impression that the soul is different from the body and that when the body is finished, or one is liberated from the body, the soul remains in a void and becomes impersonal. But actually that is not the fact. How can the soul, which is so active within this body, be inactive after being liberated from the body? It is always active. If it is eternal, then it is eternally active, and its activities in the spiritual kingdom are the most confidential part of spiritual knowledge. These activities of the spirit soul are therefore indicated here as constituting the king of all knowledge, the most confidential part of all knowledge.\u00a0",
      "This knowledge is the purest form of all activities, as is explained in Vedic literature. In the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a, man\u2019s sinful activities have been analyzed and are shown to be the results of sin after sin. Those who are engaged in fruitive activities are entangled in different stages and forms of sinful reactions. For instance, when the seed of a particular tree is sown, the tree does not appear immediately to grow; it takes some time. It is first a small, sprouting plant, then it assumes the form of a tree, then it flowers, bears fruit, and, when it is complete, the flowers and fruits are enjoyed by persons who have sown the seed of the tree. Similarly, a man performs a sinful act, and like a seed it takes time to fructify. There are different stages. The sinful action may have already stopped within the individual, but the results or the fruit of that sinful action are still enjoyed. There are sins which are still in the form of a seed, and there are others which are already fructified and are giving us fruit, which we are enjoying as distress and pain, as explained in the twentieth verse of the Seventh Chapter.\u00a0",
      "A person who has completely ended the reactions of all sinful activities and who is fully engaged in pious activities, being freed from the duality of this material world, becomes engaged in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. In other words, those who are actually engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord are already freed from all reactions. For those who are engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all sinful reactions, whether fructified, in the stock, or in the form of a seed, gradually vanish. Therefore the purifying potency of devotional service is very strong, and it is called pavitram uttamam, the purest. Uttamam means transcendental. Tamas means this material world or darkness, and uttamam means that which is transcendental to material activities. Devotional activities are never to be considered material, although sometimes it appears that devotees are engaged just like ordinary men. One who can see and is familiar with devotional service, however, will know that they are not material activities. They are all spiritual and devotional, uncontaminated by the material modes of nature.",
      "It is said that the execution of devotional service is so perfect that one can perceive the results directly. This direct result is actually perceived, and we have practical experience that any person who is chanting the holy names of Kṛṣṇa (Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare) in course of time feels some transcendental pleasure and very quickly becomes purified of all material contamination. This is actually seen. Furthermore, if one engages not only in hearing but in trying to broadcast the message of devotional activities as well, or if he engages himself in helping the missionary activities of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he gradually feels spiritual progress. This advancement in spiritual life does not depend on any kind of previous education or qualification. The method itself is so pure that by simply engaging in it one becomes pure.",
      "In the Vedānta-sūtra this is also described in the following words: prakāśaś ca karmaṇy abhyāsāt. “Devotional service is so potent that simply by engaging in the activities of devotional service, one becomes enlightened without a doubt.” Nārada, who happened to be the son of a maidservant, had no education, nor was he born into a high family. But when his mother was engaged in serving great devotees, Nārada also became engaged, and sometimes, in the absence of his mother, he would serve the great devotees himself. Nārada personally says, “Once only, by their permission, I took the remnants of their food, and by so doing all my sins were at once eradicated. Thus being engaged, I became purified in heart, and at that time the very nature of the transcendentalist became attractive to me.” (Bhāg. 1.5.25) Nārada tells his disciple Vyāsadeva that in a previous life he was engaged as a boy servant of purified devotees during four months of their stay and that he was intimately associating with them. Sometimes those sages left remnants of food on their dishes, and the boy, who would wash their dishes, wanted to taste the remnants. So he asked the great devotees whether he could eat them, and they gave their permission. Nārada then ate those remnants and consequently became freed from all sinful reactions. As he went on eating, he gradually became as purehearted as the sages, and he gradually developed the same taste. The great devotees relished the taste of unceasing devotional service of the Lord, hearing, chanting, etc., and by developing the same taste, Nārada wanted also to hear and chant the glories of the Lord. Thus by associating with the sages, he developed a great desire for devotional service. Therefore he quotes from the Vedānta-sūtra (prakāśaś ca karmaṇy abhyāsāt): If one is engaged simply in the acts of devotional service, everything is revealed to him automatically, and he can understand. This is called prakāśaḥ, directly perceived.",
      "Nārada was actually a son of a maidservant. He had no opportunity to go to school. He was simply assisting his mother, and fortunately his mother rendered some service to the devotees. The child Nārada also got the opportunity and simply by association achieved the highest goal of all religions, devotional service. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it is said that religious people generally do not know that the highest perfection of religion is the attainment of the stage of devotional service. Generally Vedic knowledge is required for the understanding of the path of self-realization. But here, although he was not educated in the Vedic principle, Nārada acquired the highest results of Vedic study. This process is so potent that even without performing the religious process regularly, one can be raised to the highest perfection. How is this possible? This is also confirmed in Vedic literature: ācāryavān puruṣo veda. One who is in association with great ācāryas, even if he is not educated or has not studied the Vedas, can become familiar with all the knowledge necessary for realization.",
      "The process of devotional service is a very happy one. Why? Devotional service consists of śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ, so one can simply hear the chanting of the glories of the Lord or can attend philosophical lectures on transcendental knowledge given by authorized ācāryas. Simply by sitting, one can learn; then one can eat the remnants of the food offered to God, nice palatable dishes. In every state devotional service is joyful. One can execute devotional service even in the most poverty-stricken condition. The Lord says, patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalam: He is ready to accept from the devotee any kind of offering, never mind what. Even a leaf, a flower, a bit of fruit, or a little water, which are all available in every part of the world, can be offered by any person, regardless of social position, and will be accepted if offered with love. There are many instances in history. Simply by tasting the tulasī leaves offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, great sages like Sanatkumāra became great devotees. Therefore the devotional process is very nice, and it can be executed in a happy mood. God accepts only the love with which things are offered to Him.",
      "It is said here that this devotional service is eternally existing. It is not as the Māyāvādī philosophers claim. They sometimes take to so-called devotional service, and as long as they are not liberated they continue their devotional service, but at the end, when they become liberated, they “become one with God.” Such temporary time-serving devotional service is not accepted as pure devotional service. Actual devotional service continues even after liberation. When the devotee goes to the spiritual planet in the kingdom of God, he is also engaged there in serving the Supreme Lord. He does not try to become one with the Supreme Lord.",
      "As it will be seen, actual devotional service begins after liberation. So in Bhagavad-gītā it is said, brahma-bhūta. After being liberated, or being situated in the Brahman position, one’s devotional service begins. By executing devotional service, one can understand the Supreme Lord. No one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by executing karma-yoga, jñāna, or aṣṭāṅga-yoga or any other yoga independently. Without coming to the stage of devotional service, one cannot understand what is the Personality of Godhead. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it is also confirmed that when one becomes purified by executing the process of devotional service, especially by hearing Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam or Bhagavad-gītā from realized souls, then he can understand the science of Kṛṣṇa or the science of God. Evaṁ prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ. When one’s heart is cleared of all nonsense, then one can understand what God is. Thus the process of devotional service, of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is the king of all education and the king of all confidential knowledge. It is the purest form of religion, and it can be executed joyfully without difficulty. Therefore one should adopt it."

      "The faithless cannot accomplish this process of devotional service; that is the purport of this verse. Faith is created by association with devotees. Unfortunate people, even after hearing all the evidence of Vedic literature from great personalities, still have no faith in God. They are hesitant and cannot stay fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. Thus faith is a most important factor for progress in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta it is said that one should have complete conviction that simply by serving the Supreme Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he can achieve all perfection. That is called real faith. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.4.12)\u015ar\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam 3.4.12O honest one, your present life is the last and the supermost because in this term of life you have been awarded My ultimate favor. Now you can go to My transcendental abode, Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, by leaving this universe of conditioned living entities. Your visit to Me in this lonely place because of your pure and unflinching devotional service is a great boon for you. it is stated that by giving water to the root of a tree, its branches, twigs and leaves become satisfied, and by supplying food to the stomach all the senses of the body become satisfied, and, similarly, by engaging in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord, all the demigods and all the living entities automatically become satisfied.\u00a0",
      "After reading Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 one should promptly come to the conclusion of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: one should give up all other engagements and adopt the service of the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead. If one is convinced of this philosophy of life, that is faith. Now the development of that faith is the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u00a0",
      "There are three divisions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious men. In the third class are those who have no faith. If they are engaged in devotional service officially, for some ulterior purpose, they cannot achieve the highest perfectional stage. Most probably they will slip, after some time. They may become engaged, but because they haven\u2019t complete conviction and faith, it is very difficult for them to continue in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. We have practical experience in discharging our missionary activity that some people come and apply themselves to the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness with some hidden motive, and as soon as they are economically a little well-situated, they give up this process and take to their old ways again. It is only by faith that one can advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. As far as the development of faith is concerned, one who is well versed in the literatures of devotional service and has attained the stage of firm faith is called a first-class person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. And in the second class are those who are not very advanced in understanding the devotional scriptures but who automatically have firm faith that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a bhakti or service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the best course and so in good faith have taken it up. Thus they are superior to the third class who have neither perfect knowledge of the scriptures nor good faith but by association and simplicity are trying to follow. The third-class person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness may fall down, but when one is in the second class or first class, he does not fall down. One in the first class will surely make progress and achieve the result at the end. As far as the third-class person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is concerned, although he has faith in the conviction that devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very good, he has no knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a through the scriptures like \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Sometimes these third-class persons in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness have some tendency toward karma-yoga and j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, and sometimes they are disturbed, but as soon as the infection of karma-yoga or j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga is vanquished, they become second-class or first-class persons in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Faith in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also divided into three stages and described in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. First-class attachment, second-class attachment, and third-class attachment are also explained in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam in the Eleventh Canto. Those who have no faith even after hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the excellence of devotional service, who think that it is simply eulogy, find the path very difficult, even if they are supposedly engaged in devotional service. For them there is very little hope in gaining perfection. Thus faith is very important in the discharge of devotional service.\u00a0"

      "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not perceivable through the gross material senses. It is said that Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s name, fame, pastimes, etc., cannot be understood by material senses. Only to one who is engaged in pure devotional service under proper guidance is He revealed. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is stated, prem\u0101\u00f1janacchurita\u2026. One can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, always within himself and outside himself if he has developed the transcendental loving attitude towards Him. Thus for people in general He is not visible. Here it is said that although He is all-pervading, everywhere present, He is yet not conceivable by the material senses. But actually, although we cannot see Him, everything is resting in Him. As we have discussed in the Seventh Chapter, the entire material cosmic manifestation is only a combination of His two different energies, the superior spiritual energy and the inferior material energy. Just as the sunshine is spread all over the universe, the energy of the Lord is spread all over the creation, and everything is resting in that energy.\u00a0",
      "Yet one should not conclude that because He is spread all over He has lost His personal existence. To refute such argument the Lord says, \u201cI am everywhere, and everything is in Me, but still I am aloof.\u201d For example, a king heads a government which is but the manifestation of the king\u2019s energy; the different governmental departments are nothing but the energies of the king, and each department is resting on the king\u2019s power. But still one cannot expect the king to be present in every department personally. That is a crude example. Similarly, all the manifestations that we see, and everything that exists both in this material world and in the spiritual world, are resting on the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The creation takes place by the diffusion of His different energies, and, as is stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, He is everywhere present by His personal representation, the diffusion of His different energies.\u00a0"

      "The Lord says that everything is resting on Him. This should not be misunderstood. The Lord is not directly concerned with the maintenance and sustenance of this material manifestation. Sometimes we see a picture of Atlas holding the globe on his shoulders; he seems to be very tired, holding this great earthly planet. Such an image should not be entertained in connection with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s upholding this created universe. He says that although everything is resting on Him, still He is aloof. The planetary systems are floating in space, and this space is the energy of the Supreme Lord. But He is different from space. He is differently situated. Therefore the Lord says, \u201cAlthough they are situated on My inconceivable energy, still, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I am aloof from them.\u201d This is the inconceivable opulence of the Lord.\u00a0",

But when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wants to do something, simply by His willing, everything is performed so perfectly that one cannot imagine how it is being done. The Lord explains this fact: although He is the maintainer and sustainer of all material manifestation, He does not touch this material manifestation. Simply by His supreme will everything is created, everything is sustained, everything is maintained, and everything is annihilated. There is no difference between His mind and Himself (as there is a difference between ourselves and our present material mind) because He is absolute spirit. Simultaneously the Lord is present in everything; yet the common man cannot understand how He is also present personally. He is different from this material manifestation, yet everything is resting on Him. This is explained here as yogam ai\u015bvaram, the mystic power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u00a0"

      "For the ordinary person it is almost inconceivable how the huge material creation is resting in Him. But the Lord is giving an example which may help us to understand. Space is the biggest manifestation we can conceive. The cosmic manifestation rests in space. Space permits the movement of even the atoms and on up to the greatest planets, the sun and the moon. Although the sky (or wind or air) is great, still it is situated within space. Space is not beyond the sky.\u00a0",
      "Similarly, all the wonderful cosmic manifestations are existing by the supreme will of God, and all of them are subordinate to that supreme will. As we generally say, not a blade of grass moves without the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus everything is moving under His will: by His will everything is being created, everything is being maintained, and everything is being annihilated. Still He is aloof from everything, as space is always aloof from the activities of the atmosphere. In the Upani\u1e63ads, it is stated, \u201cIt is out of the fear of the Supreme Lord that the wind is blowing.\u201d In the Garga Upani\u1e63ad also it is stated, \u201cBy the supreme order, under the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the moon, the sun and the great planets are moving.\u201d In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 this is also stated. There is also a description of the movement of the sun, and it is said that the sun is considered to be one of the eyes of the Supreme Lord and that it has immense potency to diffuse heat and light. Still it is moving in its prescribed orbit by the order and the supreme will of Govinda. So, from the Vedic literature we can find evidence that this material manifestation, which appears to us to be very wonderful and great, is under the complete control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This will be further explained in the later verses of this chapter.\u00a0"

It is clearly stated here that the living entities have nothing to do with this process. The state of being in their past life in the past creation is simply manifested again, and all this is done simply by His will. This is the inconceivable potency of the Supreme Personality of God. And after creating different species of life, He has no connection with them. The creation takes place to accommodate the inclinations of the various living entities, and so the Lord does not become involved with it.\u00a0"

All these living entities, although born under the glance of the Supreme Lord, still take their different bodies according to their past deeds and desires. So the Lord is not directly attached to this material creation. He simply glances over material nature; material nature is thus activated, and everything is created immediately. Because He glances over material nature, there is undoubtedly activity on the part of the Supreme Lord, but He has nothing to do with the manifestation of the material world directly. This example is given in the sm\u1e5bti: when there is a fragrant flower before someone, the fragrance is touched by the smelling power of the person, yet the smelling and the flower are detached from one another. There is a similar connection between the material world and the Supreme Personality of Godhead; actually He has nothing to do with this material world, but He creates by His glance and ordains. In summary, material nature, without the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, cannot do anything. Yet the Supreme Personality is detached from all material activities.\u00a0"

The Personality of Godhead, who conducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the complete cosmic manifestation, cannot be a human being. Yet there are many foolish men who consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be merely a powerful man and nothing more. Actually, He is the original Supreme Personality, as is confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (i\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5bs\u1e47a\u1e25); He is the Supreme Lord.\u00a0",
      "There are many \u012b\u015bvaras, controllers, and one appears greater than another. In the ordinary management of affairs in the material world, we find some official or director, and above him there is a secretary, and above him a minister, and above him a president. Each of them is a controller, but one is controlled by another. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is said that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme controller; there are many controllers undoubtedly both in the material and spiritual world, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme controller (\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25), and His body is sac-cid-\u0101nanda, non-material.\u00a0",
      "Material bodies cannot perform the wonderful acts described in previous verses. His body is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge. Although He is not a common man, the foolish deride Him and consider Him to be a man. His body is called here m\u0101nu\u1e63\u012bm because He is acting just like a man, a friend of Arjuna\u2019s, a politician involved in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra. In so many ways He is acting just like an ordinary man, but actually His body is sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha— eternal bliss and knowledge absolute. This is confirmed in the Vedic language also (sac-cid-\u0101nanda-r\u016bp\u0101ya k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101ya): \u201cI offer my obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the eternal blissful form of knowledge.\u201d There are other descriptions in the Vedic language also. Tam eka\u1e41 govindam: \u201cYou are Govinda, the pleasure of the senses and the cows.\u201d Sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraham: \u201cAnd Your form is transcendental, full of knowledge, bliss and eternality.\u201d\u00a0",
      "Despite the transcendental qualities of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body, its full bliss and knowledge, there are many so-called scholars and commentators of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 who deride K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as an ordinary man. The scholar may be born an extraordinary man due to his previous good work, but this conception of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is due to a poor fund of knowledge. Therefore he is called m\u016b\u1e0dha, for only foolish persons consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be an ordinary human being because they do not know the confidential activities of the Supreme Lord and His different energies. They do not know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body is a symbol of complete knowledge and bliss, that He is the proprietor of everything that be and that He can award liberation to anyone. Because they do not know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has so many transcendental qualifications, they deride Him.\u00a0"

Similarly, those who are engaged in fruitive, pious activities and who are ultimately hoping to be liberated from this material entanglement will never be successful either because they deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In other words, persons who mock K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are to be understood to be demonic or atheistic. As described in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, such demonic miscreants never surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore their mental speculations to arrive at the Absolute Truth bring them to the false conclusion that the ordinary living entity and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are one and the same. With such a false conviction, they think that the body of any human being is now simply covered by material nature and that as soon as one is liberated from this material body there is no difference between God and himself. This attempt to become one with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will be baffled because of delusion. Such atheistic and demoniac cultivation of spiritual knowledge is always futile. That is the indication of this verse. For such persons, cultivation of the knowledge in the Vedic literature, like the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra and the Upani\u1e63ads, is always baffled.\u00a0",
      "It is a great offense, therefore, to consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to be an ordinary man. Those who do so are certainly deluded because they cannot understand the eternal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In the B\u1e5bhad-vai\u1e63\u1e47ava mantra it is clearly stated that one who considers the body of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be material should be driven out from all rituals and activities of the \u015bruti. And if one by chance sees his face, he should at once take bath in the Ganges to rid himself of infection. People jeer at K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because they are envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Their destiny is certainly to take birth after birth in the species of atheistic and demoniac life.

      "In this verse the description of mah\u0101tm\u0101 is clearly given. The first sign of the mah\u0101tm\u0101 is that he is already situated in the divine nature. He is not under the control of material nature. And how is this effected? That is explained in the Seventh Chapter: one who surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, at once becomes freed from the control of material nature. That is the qualification. One can become free from the control of material nature as soon as he surrenders his soul to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the preliminary formula. Being marginal potency, as soon as the living entity is freed from the control of material nature, he is put under the guidance of the spiritual nature. The guidance of the spiritual nature is called daiv\u012b\u1e41 prak\u1e5btim, divine nature. So, when one is promoted in that way-by surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead-one attains to the stage of great soul, mah\u0101tm\u0101.\u00a0",
      "The mah\u0101tm\u0101 does not divert his attention to anything outside K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because he knows perfectly well that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original Supreme Person, the cause of all causes. There is no doubt about it. Such a mah\u0101tm\u0101, or great soul, develops through association with other mah\u0101tm\u0101s, pure devotees. Pure devotees are not even attracted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s other features, such as the four-armed Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. They are simply attracted by the two-armed form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Since they are not attracted to other features of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (what to speak of the demigods), they are not concerned with any form of a demigod or of a human being. They only meditate upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. They are always engaged in the unswerving service of the Lord in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u00a0"

He is always engaged in the glorification of the Lord. In other words, he is not an impersonalist. When the question of glorification is there, one has to glorify the Supreme Lord, praising His holy name, His eternal form, His transcendental qualities and His uncommon pastimes. One has to glorify all these things; therefore a mah\u0101tm\u0101 is attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u00a0",
      "One who is attached to the impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord, the brahmajyoti, is not described as mah\u0101tm\u0101 in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. He is described in a different way in the next verse. The mah\u0101tm\u0101 is always engaged in different activities of devotional service, as described in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, hearing and chanting about Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, not a demigod or human being. That is devotion: \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25, smara\u1e47am, and remembering Him. Such a mah\u0101tm\u0101 has firm determination to achieve at the ultimate end the association of the Supreme Lord in any one of the five transcendental rasas. To achieve that success, he engages all activities-mental, bodily and vocal, everything-in the service of the Supreme Lord, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is called full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u00a0",
      "In devotional service there are certain activities which are called determined, such as fasting on certain days, like the eleventh day of the moon, Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b, and on the appearance day of the Lord, etc. All these rules and regulations are offered by the great \u0101c\u0101ryas for those who are actually interested in getting admission into the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the transcendental world. The mah\u0101tm\u0101s, great souls, strictly observe all these rules and regulations, and therefore they are sure to achieve the desired result.\u00a0",
      "As described in the second verse of this chapter, this devotional service is not only easy, but it can be performed in a happy mood. One does not need to undergo any severe penance and austerity. He can live this life in devotional service, guided by an expert spiritual master, and in any position, either as a householder or a sanny\u0101s\u012b, or a brahmac\u0101r\u012b; in any position and anywhere in the world, he can perform this devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus become actually mah\u0101tm\u0101, a great soul.\u00a0"

The Lord tells Arjuna that those who are purely in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and do not know anything other than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are called mah\u0101tm\u0101; yet there are other persons who are not exactly in the position of mah\u0101tm\u0101 but who worship K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also, in different ways. Some of them are already described as the distressed, the financially destitute, the inquisitive, and those who are engaged in the cultivation of knowledge. But there are others who are still lower, and these are divided into three: 1) He who worships himself as one with the Supreme Lord, 2) He who concocts some form of the Supreme Lord and worships that, and 3) He who accepts the universal form, the vi\u015bvar\u016bpa of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and worships that. Out of the above three, the lowest, those who worship themselves as the Supreme Lord, thinking themselves to be monists, are most predominant. Such people think themselves to be the Supreme Lord, and in this mentality they worship themselves. This is also a type of God worship, for they can understand that they are not the material body but are actually spiritual soul; at least, such a sense is prominent. Generally the impersonalists worship the Supreme Lord in this way. The second class includes the worshipers of the demigods, those who by imagination consider any form to be the form of the Supreme Lord. And the third class includes those who cannot conceive of anything beyond the manifestation of this material universe. They consider the universe to be the supreme organism or entity and worship that. The universe is also a form of the Lord.\u00a0"

      "Gati means the destination where we want to go. But the ultimate goal is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, although people do not know it. One who does not know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is misled, and his so-called progressive march is either partial or hallucinatory. There are many who make as their destination different demigods, and by rigid performance of the strict respective methods they reach different planets known as Candraloka, S\u016bryaloka, Indraloka, Maharloka, etc. But all such lokas or planets, being creations of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, are simultaneously K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Actually such planets, being the manifestations of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy, are also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but actually they only serve as a step forward for realization of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. To approach the different energies of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is to approach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a indirectly. One should directly approach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, for that will save time and energy. For example, if there is a possibility of going to the top of a building by the help of an elevator, why should one go by the staircase, step by step? Everything is resting on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy; therefore without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s shelter nothing can exist. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme ruler because everything belongs to Him and everything exists on His energy. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being situated in everyone\u2019s heart, is the supreme witness. The residences, countries or planets on which we live are also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the ultimate goal of shelter, and as such one should take shelter of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a either for protection or for annihilation of his distressed condition. And whenever we have to take protection, we should know that our protection must be a living force. Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme living entity. Since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the source of our generation, or the supreme father, no one can be a better friend than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, nor can anyone be a better well-wisher. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original source of creation and the ultimate rest after annihilation. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is therefore the eternal cause of all causes.\u00a0"

Actual tri-ved\u012bs take shelter under the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and engage in pure devotional service to satisfy the Lord. Devotional service begins with the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra and side by side trying to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in truth. Unfortunately those who are simply official students of the Vedas become more interested in offering sacrifices to the different demigods like Indra, Candra, etc. By such endeavor, the worshipers of different demigods are certainly purified of the contamination of the lower qualities of nature and are thereby elevated to the higher planetary system or heavenly planets known as Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, etc. Once situated on those higher planetary systems, one can satisfy his senses hundreds of thousands of times better than on this planet.\u00a0"

      "Here it is clearly stated that there are many types of yaj\u00f1a performances recommended in the Vedic literatures, but actually all of them are meant for satisfying the Supreme Lord. Yaj\u00f1a means Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. In the Second Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is clearly stated that one should only work for satisfying Yaj\u00f1a or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The perfectional form of human civilization, known as var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, is specifically meant for satisfying Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Therefore, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in this verse, \u201cI am the enjoyer of all sacrifices because I am the supreme master.\u201d However, less intelligent persons, without knowing this fact, worship demigods for temporary benefit. Therefore they fall down to material existence and do not achieve the desired goal of life. If, however, anyone has any material desire to be fulfilled, he had better pray for it to the Supreme Lord (although that is not pure devotion), and he will thus achieve the desired result.\u00a0"

      "If anyone has any desire to go to the moon, the sun, or any other planet, one can attain the desired destination by following specific Vedic principles recommended for that purpose. These are vividly described in the fruitive activities portion of the Vedas, technically known as dar\u015ba-paur\u1e47am\u0101s\u012b, which recommends a specific worship of demigods situated on different heavenly planets. Similarly, one can attain the pit\u0101 planets by performing a specific yaj\u00f1a. Similarly, one can go to many ghostly planets and become a yak\u1e63a, rak\u1e63a or pi\u015b\u0101ca. Pi\u015b\u0101ca worship is called \u201cblack arts\u201d or \u201cblack magic.\u201d There are many men who practice this black art, and they think that it is spiritualism, but such activities are completely materialistic. Similarly, a pure devotee, who worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead only, achieves the planets of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka without a doubt. It is very easy to understand through this important verse that if by simply worshiping the demigods one can achieve the heavenly planets, or by worshiping the pit\u0101 achieve the pit\u0101 planets, or by practicing the black arts achieve the ghostly planets, why can the pure devotee not achieve the planet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u? Unfortunately many people have no information of these sublime planets where K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u live, and because they do not know of them they fall down. Even the impersonalists fall down from the brahmajyoti. This K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is therefore distributing sublime information to the entire human society to the effect that by simply chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra one can become perfect in this life and go back home, back to Godhead.\u00a0"

      "Here Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, having established that He is the only enjoyer, the primeval Lord, and the real object of all sacrificial offerings, reveals what types of sacrifices He desires to be offered. If one wishes to engage in devotional service to the Supreme in order to be purified and to reach the goal of life— the transcendental loving service of God— then he should find out what the Lord desires of him. One who loves K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will give Him whatever He wants, and he avoids offering anything which is undesirable or unasked for. Thus, meat, fish and eggs should not be offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If He desired such things as offerings, He would have said so. Instead He clearly requests that a leaf, fruit, flowers and water be given to Him, and He says of this offering, \u201cI will accept it.\u201d Therefore, we should understand that He will not accept meat, fish and eggs. Vegetables, grains, fruits, milk and water are the proper foods for human beings and are prescribed by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. Whatever else we eat cannot be offered to Him, since He will not accept it. Thus we cannot be acting on the level of loving devotion if we offer such foods.\u00a0",
      "In the Third Chapter, verse thirteen, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explains that only the remains of sacrifice are purified and fit for consumption by those who are seeking advancement in life and release from the clutches of the material entanglement. Those who do not make an offering of their food, He says in the same verse, are said to be eating only sin. In other words, their every mouthful is simply deepening their involvement in the complexities of material nature. But preparing nice, simple vegetable dishes, offering them before the picture or Deity of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and bowing down and praying for Him to accept such a humble offering, enable one to advance steadily in life, to purify the body, and to create fine brain tissues which will lead to clear thinking. Above all, the offering should be made with an attitude of love. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has no need of food, since He already possesses everything that be, yet He will accept the offering of one who desires to please Him in that way. The important element, in preparation, in serving and in offering, is to act with love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u00a0",
      "The impersonalist philosophers, who wish to maintain that the Absolute Truth is without senses, cannot comprehend this verse of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. To them, it is either a metaphor or proof of the mundane character of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the speaker of the G\u012bt\u0101. But, in actuality, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Godhead, has senses, and it is stated that His senses are interchangeable; in other words, one sense can perform the function of any other. This is what it means to say that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is absolute. Lacking senses, He could hardly be considered full in all opulences. In the Seventh Chapter, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has explained that He impregnates the living entities into material nature. This is done by His looking upon material nature. And so in this instance, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s hearing the devotee\u2019s words of love in offering foodstuffs is wholly identical with His eating and actually tasting. This point should be emphasized: because of His absolute position, His hearing is wholly identical with His eating and tasting. Only the devotee, who accepts K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He describes Himself, without interpretation, can understand that the Supreme Absolute Truth can eat food and enjoy it.\u00a0"

      "R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b says that as long as we are in this material world we have to act; we cannot cease acting.

Actually situated in renunciation, such activities clear the mirror of the mind, and as the actor gradually makes progress in spiritual realization he becomes completely surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore at the end he becomes liberated, and this liberation is also specified. By this liberation he does not become one with the brahmajyoti but rather enters into the planet of the Supreme Lord. It is clearly mentioned here: m\u0101m upai\u1e63yasi, \u201che comes to Me,\u201d back home, back to Godhead. There are five different stages of liberation, and here it is specified that the devotee who has always lived his lifetime here under the direction of the Supreme Lord, as stated, has evolved to the point where he can, after quitting this body, go back to Godhead and engage directly in the association of the Supreme Lord.\u00a0",
      "Anyone who has no other interest but to dedicate his life to the service of the Lord is actually a sanny\u0101s\u012b Such a person always thinks of himself as an eternal servant, dependant on the supreme will of the Lord. As such, whatever he does, he does it for the benefit of the Lord. Whatever action he performs, he performs it as service to the Lord. He does not give serious attention to the fruitive activities or prescribed duties mentioned in the Vedas. For ordinary persons it is obligatory to execute the prescribed duties mentioned in the Vedas, but although a pure devotee who is completely engaged in the service of the Lord may sometimes appear to go against the prescribed Vedic duties, actually it is not so.\u00a0",

A person who is thus always engaged in the service of the Lord or is always thinking and planning how to serve the Lord is to be considered completely liberated at present and in the future. His going home, back to Godhead, is guaranteed. He is above all materialistic criticism, just as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is above all criticism.\u00a0"

      "One may question here that if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is equal to everyone and no one is His special friend, then why does He take a special interest in the devotees who are always engaged in His transcendental service? But this is not discrimination; it is natural. Any man in this material world may be very charitably disposed, yet he has a special interest in his own children. The Lord claims that every living entity-in whatever form-is His son, and as such He provides everyone with a generous supply of the necessities of life. He is just like a cloud which pours rain all over, regardless whether it falls on rock or land or water. But for His devotees, He gives specific attention. Such devotees are mentioned here: they are always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and therefore they are always transcendentally situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The very phrase K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness suggests that those who are in such consciousness are living transcendentalists, situated in Him. The Lord says here distinctly, \u201cmayi te,\u201d \u201cin Me.\u201d Naturally, as a result, the Lord is also in them. This is reciprocal. This also explains the words: asti na priya\u1e25/ye bhajanti: \u201cWhoever surrenders unto Me, proportionately I take care of him.\u201d This transcendental reciprocation exists because both the Lord and the devotee are conscious. When a diamond is set in a golden ring, it looks very nice. The gold is glorified, and at the same time the diamond is glorified. The Lord and the living entity eternally glitter, and when a living entity becomes inclined to the service of the Supreme Lord, he looks like gold. The Lord is a diamond, and so this combination is very nice. Living entities in a pure state are called devotees. The Supreme Lord becomes the devotee of His devotees. If a reciprocal relationship is not present between the devotee and the Lord, then there is no personalist philosophy. In the impersonal philosophy there is no reciprocation between the Supreme and the living entity, but in the personalist philosophy there is.\u00a0",
      "The example is often given that the Lord is like a desire tree, and whatever one wants from this desire tree, the Lord supplies. But here the explanation is more complete. The Lord is here stated to be partial to the devotees. This is the manifestation of the Lord\u2019s special mercy to the devotees. The Lord\u2019s reciprocation should not be considered to be under the law of karma. It belongs to the transcendental situation in which the Lord and His devotees function. Devotional service of the Lord is not an activity of this material world; it is part of the spiritual world where eternity, bliss and knowledge predominate.\u00a0"

      "The word sudur\u0101c\u0101ro used in this verse is very significant, and we should understand it properly. When a living entity is conditioned, he has two kinds of activities: one is conditional, and the other is constitutional. As for protecting the body or abiding by the rules of society and state, certainly there are different activities, even for the devotees, in connection with the conditional life, and such activities are called conditional. Besides these, the living entity who is fully conscious of his spiritual nature and is engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or the devotional service of the Lord, has activities which are called transcendental. Such activities are performed in his constitutional position, and they are technically called devotional service. Now, in the conditioned state, sometimes devotional service and the conditional service in relation to the body will parallel one another. But then again, sometimes these activities become opposed to one another. As far as possible, a devotee is very cautious so that he does not do anything that could disrupt his wholesome condition. He knows that perfection in his activities depends on his progressive realization of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Sometimes, however, it may be seen that a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness commits some act which may be taken as most abominable socially or politically. But such a temporary falldown does not disqualify him. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that if a person falls down, but is wholeheartedly engaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord, the Lord, being situated within his heart, beautifies him and excuses him from that abomination. The material contamination is so strong that even a yog\u012b fully engaged in the service of the Lord sometimes becomes ensnared; but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is so strong that such an occasional falldown is at once rectified. Therefore the process of devotional service is always a success. No one should deride a devotee for some accidental falldown from the ideal path, for, as is explained in the next verse, such occasional falldowns will be stopped in due course, as soon as a devotee is completely situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u00a0",
      "Therefore a person who is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and is engaged with determination in the process of chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare should be considered to be in the transcendental position, even if by chance or accident he is found to have fallen. The words s\u0101dhur eva, \u201che is saintly,\u201d are very emphatic. They are a warning to the nondevotees that because of an accidental falldown a devotee should not be derided; he should still be considered saintly even if he has fallen down accidentally. And the word mantavya\u1e25 is still more emphatic. If one does not follow this rule, and derides a devotee for his accidental falldown, then he is disobeying the order of the Supreme Lord. The only qualification of a devotee is to be unflinchingly and exclusively engaged in devotional service.\u00a0",
      "The mark of a spot which may be seen on the moon does not become an impediment to the moonlight. Similarly, the accidental falldown of a devotee from the path of a saintly character does not make him abominable. On the other hand, one should not misunderstand that a devotee in transcendental devotional service can act in all kinds of abominable ways; this verse only refers to an accident due to the strong power of material connections. Devotional service is more or less a declaration of war against the illusory energy. As long as one is not strong enough to fight the illusory energy, there may be accidental falldowns. But when one is strong enough, he is no longer subjected to such falldowns, as previously explained. No one should take advantage of this verse and commit nonsense and think that he is still a devotee. If he does not improve in his character by devotional service, then it is to be understood that he is not a high devotee.\u00a0"

      "This should not be misunderstood. In the Seventh Chapter the Lord says that one who is engaged in mischievous activities cannot become a devotee of the Lord. One who is not a devotee of the Lord has no good qualifications whatsoever. The question remains, then, how can a person engaged in abominable activities-either by accident or intention-be a pure devotee? This question may justly be raised. The miscreants, as stated in the Seventh Chapter, who never come to the devotional service of the Lord, have no good qualifications, as is stated in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Generally, a devotee who is engaged in the nine kinds of devotional activities is engaged in the process of cleansing all material contamination from the heart. He puts the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart, and all sinful contaminations are naturally washed away. Continuous thinking of the Supreme Lord makes him pure by nature. According to the Vedas, there is a certain regulation that if one falls down from his exalted position, he has to undergo certain ritualistic processes to purify himself. But here there is no such condition because the purifying process is already there in the heart of the devotee, due to his remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly. Therefore, the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare should be continued without stoppage.

      "In this verse it is clearly indicated that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the only means of being delivered from the clutches of this contaminated material world. Sometimes unscrupulous commentators distort the meaning of what is clearly stated here: that all devotional service should be offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Unfortunately, unscrupulous commentators divert the mind of the reader to that which is not at all feasible. Such commentators do not know that there is no difference between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mind and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not an ordinary human being; He is Absolute Truth. His body, mind and He Himself are one and absolute. It is stated in the K\u016brma Pur\u0101\u1e47a. As it is quoted by Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his Anubh\u0101\u1e63ya comments on Caitanya-carit\u0101mrta, Fifth Chapter, \u0100di-l\u012bl\u0101, verses 41-48, \u201cdeha-dehi-vibhedo \u2018ya\u1e41 ne\u015bvare vidyate kvacit,\u201d which means that there is no difference in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Lord, between Himself and His body. But, because they do not know this science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the commentators hide K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and divide His personality from His mind or from His body. Although this is sheer ignorance of the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, some men make profit out of misleading the people.\u00a0",
      "There are some who are demonic; they also think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but enviously, just like King Ka\u1e41sa, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s uncle. He was also thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a always, but he thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as his enemy. He was always in anxiety, wondering when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would come to kill him. That kind of thinking will not help us. One should be thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in devotional love. That is bhakti. One should cultivate the knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a continually. What is that favorable cultivation? It is to learn from a bona fide teacher. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and we have several times explained that His body is not material, but is eternal, blissful knowledge. This kind of talk about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will help one become a devotee. Otherwise, understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from the wrong source will prove fruitless.\u00a0",
      "One should therefore engage his mind in the eternal form, the primal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; with conviction in his heart that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme, he should engage himself in worship. There are hundreds of thousands of temples in India for the worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and devotional service is practiced there. When such practice is made, one has to offer obeisances to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should lower his head before the Deity and engage his mind, his body, his activities-everything. That will make one fully absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without deviation. This will help one transfer into the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka. One should not be deviated by unscrupulous commentators. One must engage in the nine different processes of devotional service, beginning with hearing and chanting about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Pure devotional service is the highest achievement of human society.\u00a0",
      "In the Seventh and Eighth Chapters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, pure devotional service to the Lord has been explained, apart from the yoga of knowledge and mystic yoga or fruitive activities. Those who are not purely sanctified may be attracted by different features of the Lord, like the impersonal brahmajyoti and localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, but a pure devotee directly takes to the service of the Supreme Lord.\u00a0"

While K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was present on this earth, He displayed all six opulences.

Here it is also stated by the Lord personally that He is the cause of all the demigods and sages. Even the demigods and great sages cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; they can understand neither His name nor His personality, so what is the position of the so-called scholars of this tiny planet? No one can understand why this Supreme God comes to earth as an ordinary human being and executes such commonplace and yet wonderful activities. One should know, then, that scholarship is not the qualification necessary to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Even the demigods and the great sages have tried to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by their mental speculation, and they have failed to do so. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also it is clearly said that even the great demigods are not able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They can speculate to the limits of their imperfect senses and can reach the opposite conclusion of impersonalism, of something not manifested by the three qualities of material nature, or they can imagine something by mental speculation, but it is not possible to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by such foolish speculation.\u00a0",
      "Here the Lord indirectly says that if anyone wants to know the Absolute Truth, \u201cHere I am present as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I am the Supreme.\u201d One should know this. Although one cannot understand the inconceivable Lord who is personally present, He nonetheless exists. We can actually understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, simply by studying His words in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. The impersonal Brahman can be conceived by persons who are already in the inferior energy of the Lord, but the Personality of Godhead cannot be conceived unless one is in the transcendental position.\u00a0",
      "Because most men cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His actual situation, out of His causeless mercy He descends to show favor to such speculators. Yet despite the Supreme Lord\u2019s uncommon activities, these speculators, due to contamination in the material energy, still think that the impersonal Brahman is the Supreme. Only the devotees who are fully surrendered unto the Supreme Lord can understand, by the grace of the Supreme Personality, that He is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The devotees of the Lord do not bother about the impersonal Brahman conception of God; their faith and devotion bring them to surrender immediately unto the Supreme Lord, and out of the causeless mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. No one else can understand Him. So even great sages agree: What is \u0101tm\u0101, what is the Supreme? It is He whom we have to worship.\u00a0"

Ordinary knowledge obtained by a university education pertains only to matter, and it is not accepted here as knowledge. Knowledge means knowing the distinction between spirit and matter. In modern education there is no knowledge about the spirit; they are simply taking care of the material elements and bodily needs. Therefore academic knowledge is not complete.",
      "Asaṁmohaḥ, freedom from doubt and delusion, can be achieved when one is not hesitant and when he understands the transcendental philosophy. Slowly but surely he becomes free from bewilderment. Nothing should be accepted blindly; everything should be accepted with care and with caution. Kṣamā, forgiveness, should be practiced, and one should excuse the minor offenses of others. Satyam, truthfulness, means that facts should be presented as they are for the benefit of others. Facts should not be misrepresented. According to social conventions, it is said that one can speak the truth only when it is palatable to others. But that is not truthfulness. The truth should be spoken in a straight and forward way, so that others will understand actually what the facts are. If a man is a thief and if people are warned that he is a thief, that is truth. Although sometimes the truth is unpalatable, one should not refrain from speaking it. Truthfulness demands that the facts be presented as they are for the benefit of others. That is the definition of truth.",
      "Self-control means that the senses should not be used for unnecessary personal enjoyment. There is no prohibition against meeting the proper needs of the senses, but unnecessary sense enjoyment is detrimental for spiritual advancement. Therefore the senses should be restrained from unnecessary use. Similarly, the mind should not indulge in unnecessary thoughts; that is called śamaḥ, or calmness. Nor should one spend one’s time pondering over earning money. That is a misuse of the thinking power. The mind should be used to understand the prime necessity of human beings, and that should be presented authoritatively. The power of thought should be developed in association with persons who are authorities in the scriptures, saintly persons and spiritual masters and those whose thinking is highly developed. Sukham, pleasure or happiness, should always be in that which is favorable for the cultivation of the spiritual knowledge of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And similarly, that which is painful or which causes distress is that which is unfavorable for the cultivation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Anything favorable for the development of Kṛṣṇa consciousness should be accepted, and anything unfavorable should be rejected.",
      "Bhava, birth, should be understood to refer to the body. As far as the soul is concerned, there is neither birth nor death; that we have discussed in the beginning of Bhagavad-gītā. Birth and death apply to one’s embodiment in the material world. Fear is due to worrying about the future. A person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness has no fear because by his activities he is sure to go back to the spiritual sky, back home, back to Godhead. Therefore his future is very bright. Others, however, do not know what their future holds; they have no knowledge of what the next life holds. So they are therefore in constant anxiety. If we want to get free from anxiety, then the best course is to understand Kṛṣṇa and be situated always in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In that way we will be free from all fear. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. it is stated that fear is caused by our absorption in the illusory energy, but those who are free from the illusory energy, those who are confident that they are not the material body, that they are spiritual parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are therefore engaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme Godhead, have nothing to fear. Their future is very bright. This fear is a condition of persons who are not in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Bhayam, fearlessness, is only possible for one in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. ",
      "Ahiṁsā, nonviolence, means that one should not do anything which will put others into misery or confusion. Material activities that are promised by so many politicians, sociologists, philanthropists, etc., do not produce very good results because the politicians and philanthropists have no transcendental vision; they do not know what is actually beneficial for human society. Ahiṁsā means that people should be trained in such a way that the full utilization of the human body can be achieved. The human body is meant for spiritual realization, so any movement or any commissions which do not further that end commit violence on the human body. That which furthers the future spiritual happiness of the people in general is called nonviolence.",
      "Samatā, equanimity, refers to freedom from attachment and aversion. To be very much attached or to be very much detached is not the best. This material world should be accepted without attachment or aversion. Similarly, that which is favorable for prosecuting Kṛṣṇa consciousness should be accepted; that which is unfavorable should be rejected. That is called samatā, equanimity. A person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness has nothing to reject and nothing to accept unless it is useful in the prosecution of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.",
      "Tuṣṭiḥ, satisfaction, means that one should not be eager to gather more and more material goods by unnecessary activity. One should be satisfied with whatever is obtained by the grace of the Supreme Lord; that is called satisfaction. Tapas means austerity or penance. There are many rules and definitions in the Vedas which apply here, like rising early in the morning and taking a bath. Sometimes it is very troublesome to rise early in the morning, but whatever voluntary trouble one may suffer in this way is called penance. Similarly, there are prescriptions for fasting on certain days of the month. One may not be inclined to practice such fasting, but because of his determination to make advancement in the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he should accept such bodily troubles which are recommended. However, one should not fast unnecessarily or against Vedic injunctions. One should not fast for some political purpose; that is described in Bhagavad-gītā as fasting in ignorance, and anything done in ignorance or passion does not lead to spiritual advancement. Everything done in the mode of goodness does advance one, however, and fasting done in terms of the Vedic injunctions enriches one in spiritual knowledge. ",
      "As far as charity is concerned, one should give fifty percent of his earnings to some good cause. And what is a good cause? It is that which is conducted in terms of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is not only a good cause, but it is the best cause. Because Kṛṣṇa is good, His cause is also good. Thus charity should be given to a person who is engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. According to Vedic literature, it is enjoined that charity should be given to the brāhmaṇas. This practice is still followed, although not very nicely in terms of the Vedic injunction. But still the injunction is that charity should be given to the brāhmaṇas. Why? Because they are engaged in higher cultivation of spiritual knowledge. A brāhmaṇa is supposed to devote his whole life to understanding Brahman. A brahma-jana is one who knows Brahman; he is called a brāhmaṇa. Thus charity is offered to the brāhmaṇas because since they are always engaged in higher spiritual service, they have no time to earn their livelihood. In the Vedic literature, charity is also to be awarded to the renouncer of life, the sannyāsī. The sannyāsīs beg from door to door, not for money but for missionary purposes. The system is that they go from door to door to awaken the householders from the slumber of ignorance. Because the householders are engaged in family affairs and have forgotten their actual purpose in life-awakening their Kṛṣṇa consciousness-it is the business of the sannyāsīs to go as beggars to the householders and encourage them to be Kṛṣṇa conscious. As it is said in the Vedas, one should awake and achieve what is due him in this human form of life. This knowledge and method is distributed by the sannyāsīs; hence charity is to be given to the renouncer of life, to the brāhmaṇas, and similar good causes, not to any whimsical cause.",
      "Yaśaḥ, fame, should be according to Lord Caitanya, who said that a man is famous when he is known as a great devotee. That is real fame. If one has become a great man in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and it is known, then he is truly famous. One who does not have such fame is infamous.",
      "All these qualities are manifest throughout the universe in human society and in the society of the demigods. There are many forms of humanity on other planets, and these qualities are there. Now, for one who wants to advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, Kṛṣṇa creates all these qualities, but the person develops them himself from within. One who engages in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord develops all the good qualities, as arranged by the Supreme Lord.",
      "Of whatever we find, good or bad, the origin is Kṛṣṇa. Nothing can manifest in this material world which is not in Kṛṣṇa. That is knowledge; although we know that things are differently situated, we should realize that everything flows from Kṛṣṇa."

Their minds cannot be diverted from the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Their talks are solely on the transcendental subjects. The symptoms of the pure devotees are described in this verse specifically. Devotees of the Supreme Lord are twenty-four hours daily engaged in glorifying the pastimes of the Supreme Lord. Their hearts and souls are constantly submerged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and they take pleasure in discussing Him with other devotees.\u00a0",
      "In the preliminary stage of devotional service they relish the transcendental pleasure from the service itself, and in the mature stage they are actually situated in love of God. Once situated in that transcendental position, they can relish the highest perfection which is exhibited by the Lord in His abode. Lord Caitanya likens transcendental devotional service to the sowing of a seed in the heart of the living entity. There are innumerable living entities traveling throughout the different planets of the universe, and out of them there are a few who are fortunate enough to meet a pure devotee and get the chance to understand devotional service. This devotional service is just like a seed, and if it is sown in the heart of a living entity, and if he goes on hearing and chanting, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, that seed fructifies, just as the seed of a tree fructifies with regular watering. The spiritual plant of devotional service gradually grows and grows until it penetrates the covering of the material universe and enters into the brahmajyoti effulgence in the spiritual sky. In the spiritual sky also that plant grows more and more until it reaches the highest planet, which is called Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, the supreme planet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Ultimately, the plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and rests there. Gradually, as a plant grows fruits and flowers, that plant of devotional service also produces fruits, and the watering process in the form of chanting and hearing goes on. This plant of devotional service is fully described in the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta. It is explained there that when the complete plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, one becomes fully absorbed in love of God; then he cannot live even for a moment without being in contact with the Supreme Lord, just as a fish cannot live without water. In such a state, the devotee actually attains the transcendental qualities in contact with the Supreme Lord.\u00a0",
      "The \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is also full of such narration about the relationship between the Supreme Lord and His devotees; therefore the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is very dear to the devotees. In this narration there is nothing about material activities, sense gratification or liberation. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is the only narration in which the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord and His devotees is fully described. Thus the realized souls in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness take continual pleasure in hearing such transcendental literatures, just as a young boy and girl take pleasure in association.\u00a0"

      "In this verse the word buddhi-yogam is very significant. We may remember that in the Second Chapter the Lord, instructing Arjuna, said that He had spoken to him of many things and that He would instruct him in the way of buddhi-yoga. Now buddhi-yoga is explained. Buddhi-yogam itself is action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; that is the highest intelligence. Buddhi means intelligence, and yogam means mystic activities or mystic elevation. When one tries to go back home, back to Godhead, and takes fully to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in devotional service, his action is called buddhi-yogam. In other words, buddhi-yogam is the process by which one gets out of the entanglement of this material world. The ultimate goal of progress is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. People do not know this; therefore the association of devotees and a bona fide spiritual master are important. One should know that the goal is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and when the goal is assigned, then the path is slowly but progressively traversed, and the ultimate goal is achieved.\u00a0",
      "When a person knows the goal of life but is addicted to the fruits of activities, he is acting in karma-yoga. When he knows that the goal is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but he takes pleasure in mental speculations to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is acting in j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga. And when he knows the goal and seeks K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a completely in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and devotional service, he is acting in bhakti-yoga, or buddhi-yoga, which is the complete yoga. This complete yoga is the highest perfectional stage of life.\u00a0",
      "A person may have a bona fide spiritual master and may be attached to a spiritual organization, but still, if he is not intelligent enough to make progress, then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from within gives him instructions so that he may ultimately come to Him without difficulty. The qualification is that a person always engage himself in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and with love and devotion render all kinds of services. He should perform some sort of work for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that work should be with love. If a devotee is intelligent enough, he will make progress on the path of self-realization. If one is sincere and devoted to the activities of devotional service, the Lord gives him a chance to make progress and ultimately attain to Him.\u00a0"

      "When Lord Caitanya was in Benares promulgating the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, thousands of people were following Him. Prak\u0101\u015b\u0101nanda, a very influential and learned scholar in Benares at that time, derided Lord Caitanya for being a sentimentalist. Sometimes philosophers criticize the devotees because they think that most of the devotees are in the darkness of ignorance and are philosophically naive sentimentalists. Actually that is not the fact. There are very, very learned scholars who have put forward the philosophy of devotion, but even if a devotee does not take advantage of their literatures or of his spiritual master, if he is sincere in his devotional service he is helped by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself within his heart. So the sincere devotee engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness cannot be without knowledge. The only qualification is that one carry out devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u00a0",
      "The modern philosophers think that without discriminating one cannot have pure knowledge. For them this answer is given by the Supreme Lord: those who are engaged in pure devotional service, even though they be without sufficient education and even without sufficient knowledge of the Vedic principles, are still helped by the Supreme God, as stated in this verse.\u00a0",
      "The Lord tells Arjuna that basically there is no possibility of understanding the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, simply by speculating, for the Supreme Truth is so great that it is not possible to understand Him or to achieve Him simply by making a mental effort. Man can go on speculating for several millions of years, and if he is not devoted, if he is not a lover of the Supreme Truth, he will never understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or the Supreme Truth. Only by devotional service is the Supreme Truth, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, pleased, and by His inconceivable energy He can reveal Himself to the heart of the pure devotee. The pure devotee always has K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within his heart; therefore he is just like the sun that dissipates the darkness of ignorance. This is the special mercy rendered to the pure devotee by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u00a0",
      "Due to the contamination of material association, through many, many millions of births, one\u2019s heart is always covered with the dust of materialism, but when one engages in devotional service and constantly chants Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the dust quickly clears, and one is elevated to the platform of pure knowledge. The ultimate goal of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u can be attained only by this chant and by devotional service, and not by mental speculation or argument. The pure devotee does not have to worry about the necessities of life; he need not be anxious because when he removes the darkness from his heart, everything is provided automatically by the Supreme Lord, for He is pleased by the loving devotional service of the devotee. This is the essence of the G\u012bt\u0101\u2019s teachings. By studying Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, one can become a completely surrendered soul to the Supreme Lord and engage himself in pure devotional service. As the Lord takes charge, one becomes completely free from all kinds of materialistic endeavors.\u00a0"

      "In these two verses the Supreme Lord gives a chance to the modern philosopher, for here it is clear that the Supreme is different from the individual soul. Arjuna, after hearing the essential four verses of Bhagavad-gītā in this chapter, became completely free from all doubts and accepted Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He at once boldly declares, “You are Parambrahma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” And previously Kṛṣṇa states that He is the originator of everything and everyone. Every demigod and every human being is dependent on Him. Men and demigods, out of ignorance, think that they are absolute and independent of the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa. That ignorance is removed perfectly by the discharge of devotional service. This is already explained in the previous verse by the Lord. Now by His grace, Arjuna is accepting Him as the Supreme Truth, in concordance with the Vedic injunction. It is not because Kṛṣṇa is an intimate friend of Arjuna that he is flattering Him by calling Him the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth. Whatever Arjuna says in these two verses is confirmed by Vedic truth. Vedic injunctions affirm that only one who takes to devotional service to the Supreme Lord can understand Him, whereas others cannot. Each and every word of this verse spoken by Arjuna is confirmed by Vedic injunction.",
      "In the Kena Upaniṣad it is stated that the Supreme Brahman is the rest for everything, and Kṛṣṇa has already explained that everything is resting on Him. The Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad confirms that the Supreme Lord, in whom everything is resting, can be realized only by those who engage constantly in thinking of Him. This constant thinking of Kṛṣṇa is smaraṇam, one of the methods of devotional service. It is only by devotional service to Kṛṣṇa that one can understand his position and get rid of this material body.",
      "In the Vedas the Supreme Lord is accepted as the purest of the pure. One who understands that Kṛṣṇa is the purest of the pure can become purified from all sinful activities. One cannot be disinfected from sinful activities unless he surrenders unto the Supreme Lord. Arjuna’s acceptance of Kṛṣṇa as the supreme pure complies with the injunctions of Vedic literature. This is also confirmed by great personalities, of whom Nārada is the chief.",
      "Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one should always meditate upon Him and enjoy one’s transcendental relationship with Him. He is the supreme existence. He is free from bodily needs, birth and death. Not only does Arjuna confirm this, but all the Vedic literatures, the Purāṇas and histories. In all Vedic literatures Kṛṣṇa is thus described, and the Supreme Lord Himself also says in the Fourth Chapter, “Although I am unborn, I appear on this earth to establish religious principles.” He is the supreme origin; He has no cause, for He is the cause of all causes, and everything is emanating from Him. This perfect knowledge can be had by the grace of the Supreme Lord.",
      "Here Arjuna expresses himself through the grace of Kṛṣṇa. If we want to understand Bhagavad-gītā, we should accept the statements in these two verses. This is called the paramparā system, acceptance of the disciplic succession. Unless one is in the disciplic succession, he cannot understand Bhagavad-gītā. It is not possible by so-called academic education. Unfortunately those proud of their academic education, despite so much evidence in Vedic literatures, stick to their obstinate conviction that Kṛṣṇa is an ordinary person."

By the grace of the Supreme Lord, Arjuna has understood that the Supreme Truth is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and that He is the perfect one. One should therefore follow the path of Arjuna. He received the authority of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.

Therefore, as stated in our Introduction to G\u012btopani\u1e63ad, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 should be understood in the parampar\u0101 system. When the parampar\u0101 system was lost, Arjuna was again selected to rejuvenate it.

Persons of demonic or atheistic mentality cannot know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Mental speculation that leads one away from the Supreme Lord is a serious sin, and one who does not know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should not try to comment on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the statement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and since it is the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it should be understood from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Arjuna understood it. It should not be received from atheistic persons.\u00a0",
      "The Supreme Truth is realized in three aspects: as impersonal Brahman, localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 and at last as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So at the last stage of understanding the Absolute Truth, one comes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A liberated man and even a common man may realize impersonal Brahman or localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, yet they may not understand God\u2019s personality from the verses of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, which are being spoken by this person, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Sometimes the impersonalists accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Bhagavan, or they accept His authority. Yet many liberated persons cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Puru\u1e63ottama, the Supreme Person, the father of all living entities. Therefore Arjuna addresses Him as Puru\u1e63ottama. And if one comes to know Him as the father of all the living entities, still one may not know Him as the supreme controller; therefore He is addressed here as Bh\u016bte\u015ba, the supreme controller of everyone. And even if one knows K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the supreme controller of all living entities, still one may not know that He is the origin of all the demigods; therefore He is addressed herein as Devadeva, the worshipful God of all demigods. And even if one knows Him as the worshipful God of all demigods, one may not know that He is the supreme proprietor of everything; therefore He is addressed as Jagatpati. Thus the truth about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is established in this verse by the realization of Arjuna, and we should follow in the footsteps of Arjuna to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is.\u00a0"

      "As it is stated in the previous chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is covered by His yoga-m\u0101y\u0101. Only surrendered souls and devotees can see Him. Now Arjuna is convinced that His friend, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the Supreme Godhead, but he wants to know the general process by which the all-pervading Lord can be understood by the common man. No common man, including the demons and atheists, can know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because He is guarded by His yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 energy. Again, these questions are asked by Arjuna for their benefit. The superior devotee is not only concerned for his own understanding, but for the understanding of all mankind. Out of his mercy, because he is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, a devotee, Arjuna is opening the understanding for the common man as far as the all-pervasiveness of the Supreme is concerned. He addresses K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a specifically as yogin because \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the master of the yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 energy by which He is covered and uncovered to the common man. The common man who has no love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot always think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore he has to think materially. Arjuna is considering the mode of thinking of the materialistic persons of this world.

The G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra is mentioned in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Because the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra is especially meant for God realization, it represents the Supreme Lord. This mantra is meant for spiritually advanced people, and when one attains success in chanting it, he can enter into the transcendental position of the Lord. One must first acquire the qualities of the perfectly situated person, the qualities of goodness according to the laws of material nature, in order to chant the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra. The G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra is very important in Vedic civilization and is considered to be the sound incarnation of Brahman.

In spring there are also many ceremonies commemorating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes; therefore this is considered to be the most joyful of all seasons, and it is the representative of the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u00a0"

The Lord here tells Arjuna that there is no point in understanding how things exist in their separate opulence and grandeur. He should know that all things are existing due to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s entering them as Supersoul.

In the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-mantra it is said that one who considers the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the same category with demigods— be they even Brahm\u0101 or \u015aiva— becomes at once an atheist.

The Lord is all-pervading by the expansion of His partial representation, the Supersoul, who enters into everything that is. Pure devotees, therefore, concentrate their minds in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in full devotional service; therefore they are always situated in the transcendental position. Devotional service and worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are very clearly indicated in this chapter in verses eight to eleven. That is the way of pure devotional service.

      "It is said that Arjuna was inspired by the relationship of wonder, and in that wonder, although he was by nature very sober, calm and quiet, he became ecstatic, his hair stood up, and he began to offer his obeisances unto the Supreme Lord with folded hands. He was not, of course, afraid. He was affected by the wonders of the Supreme Lord. The immediate context is wonder; his natural loving friendship was overwhelmed by wonder, and thus he reacted in this way.\u00a0"

      "In a previous verse the Lord promised to show Arjuna things he would by very interested in seeing. Now Arjuna sees that the leaders of the opposite party (Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Karṇa and all the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra) and their soldiers and Arjuna’s own soldiers are all being annihilated. This is an indication that Arjuna will emerge victorious in battle, despite heavy losses on both sides. It is also mentioned here that Bhīṣma, who is supposed to be unconquerable, will also be smashed. So also Karṇa.

Death cannot be checked, even if he did not fight. In fact, they were already dead. Time is destruction, and all manifestations are to be vanquished by the desire of the Supreme Lord.

This word is also very significant. The whole world is moving according to the plan of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Foolish persons who do not have sufficient knowledge think that nature is moving without a plan and all manifestations are but accidental formations. There are many so-called scientists who suggest that perhaps it was like this, or maybe like that, but there is no question of \u201cperhaps\u201d and \u201cmaybe.\u201d There is a specific plan being carried out in this material world. What is this plan? This cosmic manifestation is a chance for the conditioned souls to go back to Godhead, back to home. As long they have the domineering mentality which makes them try to lord it over material nature, they are conditioned. But anyone who can understand the plan of the Supreme Lord and cultivate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is most intelligent. The creation and destruction of the cosmic manifestation are under the superior guidance of God. Thus the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra was fought according to the plan of God. Arjuna was refusing to fight, but he was told that he should fight and at the same time desire the Supreme Lord. Then he would be happy. If one is in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and if his life is devoted to His transcendental service, he is perfect.\u00a0"

      "Although Kṛṣṇa is manifested before Arjuna in His universal form, Arjuna remembers his friendly relationship with Kṛṣṇa and is therefore asking pardon and requesting Him to excuse him for the many informal gestures which arise out of friendship. He is admitting that formerly he did not know that Kṛṣṇa could assume such a universal form, although He explained it as his intimate friend. Arjuna did not know how many times he may have dishonored Him by addressing Him as “O my friend, O Kṛṣṇa, O Yādava,” etc., without acknowledging His opulence. But Kṛṣṇa is so kind and merciful that in spite of such opulence He played with Arjuna as a friend. Such is the transcendental loving reciprocation between the devotee and the Lord. The relationship between the living entity and Kṛṣṇa is fixed eternally; it cannot be forgotten, as we can see from the behavior of Arjuna. Although Arjuna has seen the opulence in the universal form, he could not forget his friendly relationship with Kṛṣṇa. "

      "Arjuna is always in confidence with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because he is a very dear friend, and as a dear friend is gladdened by his friend\u2019s opulence, Arjuna is very joyful to see that his friend, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and can show such a wonderful universal form. But at the same time, after seeing that universal form, he is afraid that he has committed so many offenses to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a out of his unalloyed friendship. Thus his mind is disturbed out of fear, although he had no reason to fear. Arjuna therefore is asking K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to show His N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a form because He can assume any form. This universal form is material and temporary, as the material world is temporary. But in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets He has His transcendental form with four hands as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. There are innumerable planets in the spiritual sky, and in each of them K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is present by His plenary manifestations of different names. Thus Arjuna desired to see one of the forms manifest in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. Of course in each Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planet the form of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is four-handed, and the four hands hold different symbols, the conchshell, mace, lotus and disc. According to the different hands these four things are held in, the N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47as are named. All of these forms are one and the same to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore Arjuna requests to see His four-handed feature.\u00a0"

This form was glaring like the sun, and its many faces were rapidly changing. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a showed this form just to satisfy the desire of His friend Arjuna. This form was manifested by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a through His internal potency, which is inconceivable by human speculation.

In other words, all the disciplic devotees of the Lord could see the universal form which was shown to Arjuna by the mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Someone commented that this form was shown to Duryodhana also when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a went to Duryodhana to negotiate for peace.

      "The divine vision in this connection should be clearly understood. Who can have divine vision? Divine means godly. Unless one attains the status of divinity as a demigod, he cannot have divine vision. And what is a demigod? It is stated in the Vedic scriptures that those who are devotees of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are demigods. Those who are atheistic, i.e., who do not believe in Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or who only recognize the impersonal part of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme, cannot have the divine vision. It is not possible to decry K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and at the same time have the divine vision. One cannot have the divine vision without becoming divine. In other words, those who have divine vision can also see like Arjuna.\u00a0",
      "The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 gives the description of the universal form, and this description was unknown to everyone before Arjuna. Now one can have some idea of the vi\u015bva-r\u016bpa after this incidence; those who are actually divine can see the universal form of the Lord. But one cannot be divine without being a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The devotees, however, who are actually in the divine nature and who have divine vision, are not very much interested to see the universal form of the Lord. As described in the previous verse, Arjuna desired to see the four-handed form of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and he was actually afraid of the universal form.\u00a0",
      "In this verse there are some significant words, just like veda-yaj\u00f1\u0101dhya-yanai\u1e25, which refers to studying Vedic literature and the subject matter of sacrificial regulations. Veda refers to all kinds of Vedic literature, namely the four Vedas (\u1e5ak, Yajus, S\u0101ma and Atharva) and the eighteen Pur\u0101\u1e47as and Upani\u1e63ads, and Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra. One can study these at home or anywhere else. Similarly, there are s\u016btras, Kalpa-s\u016btras and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101-s\u016btras, for studying the method of sacrifice. D\u0101nai\u1e25 refers to charity which is offered to a suitable party. such as those who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Similarly, pious activities refer to the agni-hotra, etc., the prescribed duties of the different castes. Pious activities and the voluntary acceptance of some bodily pains are called tapasya. So one can perform all these, can accept bodily penances, give charity, study the Vedas, etc., but unless he is a devotee like Arjuna, it is not possible to see that universal form. Those who are impersonalists are also imagining that they are seeing the universal form of the Lord, but from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we understand that the impersonalists are not devotees. Therefore they are unable to see the universal form of the Lord.\u00a0",
      "There are many persons who create incarnations. They falsely claim an ordinary human to be an incarnation, but this is all foolishness. We should follow the principles of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, otherwise there is no possibility of attaining perfect spiritual knowledge. Although Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is considered the preliminary study of the science of God, still it is so perfect that one can distinguish what is what. The followers of a pseudo incarnation may say that they have also seen the transcendental incarnation of God, the universal form, but that is not acceptable because it is clearly stated here that unless one becomes a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one cannot see the universal form of God. So one first of all has to become a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; then he can claim that he can show the universal form of what he has seen. A devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot accept false incarnations or followers of false incarnations.\u00a0"

      "In the beginning of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 Arjuna was worried about killing Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and Dro\u1e47a, his worshipful grandfathers and masters. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said that he need not be afraid of killing his grandfather. When they tried to disrobe Draupad\u012b in the assembly, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and Dro\u1e47a were silent, and for such negligence of duty they should be killed. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a showed His universal form to Arjuna just to show him that these people were already killed for their unlawful action. That scene was shown to Arjuna because devotees are always peaceful, and they cannot perform such horrible actions. The purpose of the revelation of the universal form was shown; now Arjuna wanted to see the four-armed form, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a showed him. A devotee is not much interested in the universal form, for it does not enable one to reciprocate loving feelings. A devotee wants to offer his respectful worshiping feelings; thus he wants to see the two-handed or four-handed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a form so he can reciprocate in loving service with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u00a0"

      "In the forty-eighth verse of this chapter Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a concluded revealing His universal form and informed Arjuna that this form is not possible to be seen by so many activities, sacrifices, etc. Now here the word sudurdar\u015bam is used, indicating that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s two-handed form is still more confidential. One may be able to see the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by adding a little tinge of devotional service to various activities like penance, Vedic study and philosophical speculation, etc. It may be possible, but without a tinge of bhakti, one cannot see; that has already been explained. Still, beyond that universal form, the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a two-handed man is still more difficult to see, even for demigods like Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva. They desire to see Him, and we have evidences in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that when He was supposed to be in the womb of His mother, Devak\u012b, all the demigods from heaven came to see the marvel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They even waited to see Him. A foolish person may deride Him, but that is an ordinary person. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is actually desired to be seen by demigods like Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva in His two-armed form.\u00a0",
      "In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is also confirmed that He is not visible to the foolish persons who deride Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body, as confirmed by Brahm\u0101-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 and confirmed by Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, is completely spiritual and full of bliss and eternality. His body is never like a material body. But for some who make a study of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by reading Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 or similar Vedic scriptures, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a problem. For one using a material process, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is considered to be a great historical personality and very learned philosopher. But He isn\u2019t an ordinary man. But some think that even though He was so powerful, He had to accept a material body. Ultimately they think that the Absolute Truth is impersonal; therefore they think that from His impersonal feature He assumed a personal feature attached to material nature. This is a materialistic calculation of the Supreme Lord. Another calculation is speculative. Those who are in search of knowledge also speculate on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and consider Him to be less important than the universal form of the Supreme. Thus some think that the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a which was manifested to Arjuna is more important than His personal form. According to them, the personal form of the Supreme is something imaginary. They believe that in the ultimate issue, the Absolute Truth is not a person. But the transcendental process is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Chapter Two: to hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from authorities. That is the actual Vedic process, and those who are actually in the Vedic line hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from authority, and by repeated hearing about Him, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes dear. As we have several times discussed, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is covered by His yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 potency. He is not to be seen or revealed to anyone and everyone. Only by one to whom He reveals Himself can He be seen. This is confirmed in Vedic literature; for one who is a surrendered soul, the Absolute Truth can actually be understood. The transcendentalist, by continuous K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and by devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, can have his spiritual eyes opened and can see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by revelation. Such a revelation is not possible even for the demigods; therefore it is difficult even for the demigods to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and the advanced demigods are always in hope of seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His two-handed form. The conclusion is that although to see the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very, very difficult and not possible for anyone and everyone, it is still more difficult to understand His personal form as \u015ay\u0101masundara.\u00a0"

      "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be understood only by the process of undivided devotional service. He explicitly explains this in this verse so unauthorized commentators, who try to understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 by the speculative process, will know that they are simply wasting their time. No one can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or how He came from parents in a four-handed form and at once changed Himself into a two-handed form. It is clearly stated here that no one can see Him. Those who, however, are very experienced students of Vedic literature can learn about Him from the Vedic literature in so many ways. There are so many rules and regulations, and if one at all wants to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he must follow the regulative principles described in the authoritative literature. One can perform penance in accordance with those principles. As far as charity is concerned, it is plain that charity should be given to the devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who are engaged in His devotional service to spread the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a philosophy or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness throughout the world. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is a benediction to humanity. Lord Caitanya was appreciated by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b as the most munificent man of charity because love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which is very difficult to achieve, was distributed freely by Him. And if one worships as prescribed in the temple (in the temples in India there is always some statue, usually of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a), that is a chance to progress. For the beginners in devotional service to the Lord, temple worship is very essential, and this is confirmed in the Vedic literature.\u00a0",
      "One who has unflinching devotion for the Supreme Lord and is directed by the spiritual master can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead by revelation. For one who does not take personal training under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, it is impossible to even begin to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The word tu is specifically used here to indicate that no other process can be used, can be recommended, or can be successful in understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u00a0",
      "The personal forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the two-handed form and the four-handed, are completely different from the temporary universal form shown to Arjuna. The four-handed form is N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and the two-handed form is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; they are eternal and transcendental, whereas the universal form exhibited to Arjuna is temporary. The very word sudurdar\u015bam, meaning difficult to see, suggests that no one saw that universal form. It also suggests that amongst the devotees there was no necessity of showing it. That form was exhibited by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the request of Arjuna because in the future, when one represents himself as an incarnation of God, people can ask to see his universal form.\u00a0",
      "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a changes from the universal form to the four-handed form of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and then to His own natural form of two hands. This indicates that the four-handed forms and other forms mentioned in Vedic literature are all emanations of the original two-handed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is the origin of all emanations. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is distinct even from these forms, not to speak of the impersonal conception. As far as the four-handed forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are concerned, it is stated clearly that even the most identical four-handed form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (which is known as Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is lying on the cosmic ocean and from whose breathing so many innumerable universes are passing out and entering) is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord. Therefore one should conclusively worship the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is eternity, bliss and knowledge. He is the source of all forms of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, He is the source of all forms of incarnation, and He is the original Supreme Personality, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\u00a0"

      "Anyone who wants to approach the Supreme of all the Personalities of Godhead, on the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka planet in the spiritual sky, and be intimately connected with the Supreme Personality, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, must take this formula, as is stated by the Supreme Himself. Therefore, this verse is considered to be the essence of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is a book directed to the conditioned souls, who are engaged in the material world with the purpose of lording it over nature and who do not know of the real, spiritual life. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is meant to show how one can understand his spiritual existence and his eternal relationship with the Supreme Spiritual Personality and to teach one how to go back home, back to Godhead. Now here is the verse which clearly explains the process by which one can attain success in his spiritual activity: devotional service. As far as work is concerned, one should transfer his energy entirely to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious activities. No work should be done by any man except in relationship to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-karma. One may be engaged in various activities, but one should not be attached to the result of his work, but the result should be done for Him. For example, one may be engaged in business, but to transform that activity into K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one has to do business for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the proprietor of the business, then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should enjoy the profit of the business. If a businessman is in possession of thousands and thousands of dollars, and if he has to offer all this to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he can do it. This is work for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Instead of constructing a big building for his sense gratification, he can construct a nice temple for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and he can install the Deity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and arrange for the Deity\u2019s service, as is outlined in the authorized books of devotional service. This is all K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-karma. One should not be attached to the result of his work, but the result should be offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should also accept as pras\u0101dam, food, the remnants of offerings to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If, however, one is not able to construct a temple for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one can engage himself in cleansing the temple of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; that is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-karma. One can cultivate a garden. Anyone who has land-in India, at least, any poor man has a certain amount of land-can utilize that for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by growing flowers to offer Him. He can sow tulas\u012b plants because tulas\u012b leaves are very important, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has recommended this in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a desires that one offer Him either a leaf, or a flower, or a little water-and He is satisfied. This leaf especially refers to the tulas\u012b So one can sow tulas\u012b leaves and pour water on the plant. Thus, even the poorest man can engage in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. These are some of the examples of how one can engage in working for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u00a0",
      "The word mat-parama\u1e25 refers to one who considers the association of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His supreme abode to be the highest perfection of life. Such a person does not wish to be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or heavenly planets, or even the highest planet of this universe, Brahmaloka. He has no attraction for that. He is only attracted to being transferred to the spiritual sky. And even in the spiritual sky he is not satisfied with merging into the glowing brahmajyoti effulgence, for he wants to enter the highest spiritual planet, namely K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. He has full knowledge of that planet, and therefore he is not interested in any other. As indicated by the word mad-bhakta\u1e25, he fully engages in devotional service, specifically in the nine processes of devotional engagement: hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering prayers, carrying out the orders of the Lord, making friends with Him, and surrendering everything to Him. One can engage in all nine devotional processes, or eight, or seven, or at least in one, and that will surely make one perfect.\u00a0",
      "The term sa\u1e45ga-varjita\u1e25 is very significant. One should disassociate himself from persons who are against K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Not only are the atheistic persons against K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but also those who are attracted to fruitive activities and mental speculation. Therefore the pure form of devotional service is described in Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu as follows: any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnya\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101na-karm\u0101dy-an\u0101v\u1e5btam \u0101nuk\u016blyena k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101nu\u015b\u012blana\u1e41 bhaktir uttam\u0101. In this verse \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b clearly states that if anyone wants to execute unalloyed devotional service, he must be freed from all kinds of material contamination. He must be freed from the association of persons who are addicted to fruitive activities and mental speculation. When, freed from such unwanted association and from the contamination of material desires, one favorably cultivates knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that is called pure devotional service. \u0100nuk\u016blyasya sa\u1e45kapla\u1e25 pr\u0101tik\u016blyasya varjanam. One should think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and act for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a favorably, not unfavorably. Ka\u1e41sa was an enemy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s. From the very beginning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s birth, he planned in so many ways to kill Him, and because he was always unsuccessful, he was always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus while working, while eating and while sleeping, he was always K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious in every respect, but that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness was not favorable, and therefore in spite of his always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a twenty-four hours a day, he was considered a demon, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at last killed him. Of course anyone who is killed by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a attains salvation immediately, but that is not the aim of the pure devotee. The pure devotee does not even want salvation. He does not want to be transferred even to the highest planet, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. His only objective is to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wherever he may be.\u00a0",
      "A devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is friendly to everyone. Therefore it is said here that he has no enemy. How is this? A devotee situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness knows that only devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can relieve a person from all the problems of life. He has personal experience of this, and therefore he wants to introduce this system, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, into human society. There are many examples in history of devotees of the Lord risking their lives for the spreading of God consciousness. The favorite example is Lord Jesus Christ. He was crucified by the nondevotees, but He sacrificed His life for spreading God consciousness. Of course, it would be superficial to understand that He was killed. Similarly, in India also there are many examples, such as \u1e6ch\u0101kur Harid\u0101sa. Why such risk? Because they wanted to spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and it is difficult. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person knows that if a man is suffering, it is due to his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, the highest benefit one can render to human society is relieving one\u2019s neighbor from all material problems. In such a way, a pure devotee is engaged in the service of the Lord. Now, we can imagine how merciful K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is to those engaged in His service, risking everything for Him. Therefore it is certain that such persons must reach the supreme planet after leaving the body.\u00a0"

      "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has now explained about the personal, the impersonal and the universal and has described all kinds of devotees and yog\u012bs. Generally, the transcendentalists can be divided into two classes. One is the impersonalist, and the other is the personalist. The personalist devotee engages himself with all energy in the service of the Supreme Lord. The impersonalist engages himself not directly in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a but in meditation on the impersonal Brahman, the unmanifested.\u00a0",
      "We find in this chapter that of the different processes for realization of the Absolute Truth, bhakti-yoga, devotional service, is the highest. If one at all desires to have the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then he must take to devotional service.\u00a0",
      "Those who worship the Supreme Lord directly by devotional service are called personalists. Those who engage themselves in meditation on the impersonal Brahman are called impersonalists. Arjuna is here questioning which position is better. There are different ways to realize the Absolute Truth, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a indicates in this chapter that bhakti-yoga, or devotional service to Him, is highest of all. It is the most direct, and it is the easiest means for association with the Godhead.\u00a0",
      "In the Second Chapter the Lord explains that a living entity is not the material body but is a spiritual spark, a part of the Absolute Truth. In the Seventh Chapter He speaks of the living entity as part and parcel of the supreme whole and recommends that he transfer his attention fully to the whole. In the Eighth Chapter it is stated that whoever thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the moment of death is at once transferred to the spiritual sky, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s abode. And at the end of the Sixth Chapter the Lord says that out of all the yog\u012bs, he who thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within himself is considered to be the most perfect. So throughout the G\u012bt\u0101 personal devotion to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is recommended as the highest form of spiritual realization. Yet there are those who are still attracted to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s impersonal brahmajyoti effulgence, which is the all-pervasive aspect of the Absolute Truth and which is unmanifest and beyond the reach of the senses. Arjuna would like to know which of these two types of transcendentalists is more perfect in knowledge. In other words, he is clarifying his own position because he is attached to the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is not attached to the impersonal Brahman. He wants to know whether his position is secure. The impersonal manifestation, either in this material world or in the spiritual world of the Supreme Lord, is a problem for meditation. Actually, one cannot perfectly conceive of the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth. Therefore Arjuna wants to say, \u201cWhat is the use of such a waste of time?\u201d Arjuna experienced in the Eleventh Chapter that to be attached to the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is best because he could thus understand all other forms at the same time and there was no disturbance to his love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This important question asked of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by Arjuna will clarify the distinction between the impersonal and personal conceptions of the Absolute Truth.\u00a0"

If one approaches the Godhead by the method mentioned in this verse, he has to control the senses, render service to everyone and engage in the welfare of all beings.

  "purport": [
      "The group of transcendentalists who follow the path of the inconceivable, unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord are called j\u00f1\u0101na-yog\u012bs, and persons who are in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, engaged in devotional service to the Lord, are called bhakti-yog\u012bs. Now, here the difference between j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga and bhakti-yoga is definitely expressed. The process of j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, although ultimately bringing one to the same goal, is very troublesome, whereas the path of bhakti-yoga, the process of being in direct service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is easier and is natural for the embodied soul. The individual soul is embodied since time immemorial. It is very difficult for him to simply theoretically understand that he is not the body. Therefore, the bhakti-yog\u012b accepts the Deity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as worshipable because there is some bodily conception fixed in the mind, which can thus be applied. Of course, worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form within the temple is not idol worship. There is evidence in the Vedic literature that worship may be sagu\u1e47a and nirgu\u1e47a-of the Supreme possessing or not possessing attributes. Worship of the Deity in the temple is sagu\u1e47a worship, for the Lord is represented by material qualities. But the form of the Lord, though represented by material qualities such as stone, wood, or oil paint, is not actually material. That is the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord.\u00a0",
      "A crude example may be given here. We may find some mailboxes on the street, and if we post our letters in those boxes, they will naturally go to their destination without difficulty. But any old box, or an imitation, which we may find somewhere, which is not authorized by the post office, will not do the work. Similarly, God has an authorized representation in the Deity form, which is called arca-vigraha. This arca-vigraha is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord. God will accept service through that form. The Lord is omnipotent and all-powerful; therefore, by His incarnation as arca-vigraha, He can accept the services of the devotee, just to make it convenient for the man in conditioned life.\u00a0",
      "So, for a devotee, there is no difficulty in approaching the Supreme immediately and directly, but for those who are following the impersonal way to spiritual realization, the path is difficult. They have to understand the unmanifested representation of the Supreme through such Vedic literatures as the Upani\u1e63ads, and they have to learn the language, understand the nonperceptual feelings, and they have to realize all these processes. This is not very easy for a common man. A person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, engaged in devotional service, simply by the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master, simply by offering regulative obeisances unto the Deity, simply by hearing the glories of the Lord, and simply by eating the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Lord, realizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead very easily. There is no doubt that the impersonalists are unnecessarily taking a troublesome path with the risk of not realizing the Absolute Truth at the ultimate end. But the personalist, without any risk, trouble, or difficulty, approaches the Supreme Personality directly. A similar passage appears in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. It is stated there that if one has to ultimately surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead (This surrendering process is called bhakti.), but instead takes the trouble to understand what is Brahman and what is not Brahman and spends his whole life in that way, the result is simply troublesome. Therefore it is advised here that one should not take up this troublesome path of self-realization because there is uncertainty in the ultimate result.\u00a0",
      "A living entity is eternally an individual soul, and if he wants to merge into the spiritual whole, he may accomplish the realization of the eternal and knowledgeable aspects of his original nature, but the blissful portion is not realized. By the grace of some devotee, such a transcendentalist, highly learned in the process of j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, may come to the point of bhakti-yoga, or devotional service. At that time, long practice in impersonalism also becomes a source of trouble, because he cannot give up the idea. Therefore an embodied soul is always in difficulty with the unmanifest, both at the time of practice and at the time of realization. Every living soul is partially independant, and one should know for certain that this unmanifested realization is against the nature of his spiritual blissful self. One should not take up this process. For every individual living entity the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which entails full engagement in devotional service, is the best way. If one wants to ignore this devotional service, there is the danger of turning to atheism. Thus this process of centering attention on the unmanifested, the inconceivable, which is beyond the approach of the senses, as already expressed in this verse, should never be encouraged at any time, especially in this age. It is not advised by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u00a0"

      "It is explicitly stated here that the devotees are very fortunate to be delivered very soon from material existence by the Lord. In pure devotional service one comes to the realization that God is great and that the individual soul is subordinate to Him. His duty is to render service to the Lord-if not, then he will render service to māyā.",
      "As stated before, the Supreme Lord can only be appreciated by devotional service. Therefore, one should be fully devoted. One should fix his mind fully on Kṛṣṇa in order to achieve Him. One should work only for Kṛṣṇa. It does not matter in what kind of work one engages, but that work should be done only for Kṛṣṇa. That is the standard of devotional service. The devotee does not desire any achievement other than pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His life’s mission is to please Kṛṣṇa, and he can sacrifice everything for Kṛṣṇa’s satisfaction, just as Arjuna did in the Battle of Kurukṣetra. The process is very simple: one can devote himself in his occupation and engage at the same time in chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Such transcendental chanting attracts the devotee to the Personality of Godhead.",
      "The Supreme Lord herein promises that He will without delay deliver a pure devotee thus engaged from the ocean of material existence. Those who are advanced in yoga practice can willfully transfer the soul to whatever planet they like by the yoga process, and others take the opportunity in various ways, but as far as the devotee is concerned, it is clearly stated here that the Lord Himself takes him. He does not need to wait to become very experienced in order to transfer himself to the spiritual sky.",
      "In the Varāha Purāṇa this verse appears:",
      "nayāmi paramaṁ sthānam\n arcirādi-gatiṁ vinā\n garuḍa-skandham āropya\n yatheccham anivāritaḥ\n    ",
      "The purport of this verse is that a devotee does not need to practice aṣṭāṅga-yoga in order to transfer his soul to the spiritual planets. The responsibility is taken by the Supreme Lord Himself. He clearly states here that He Himself becomes the deliverer. A child is completely cared for by his parents, and thus his position is secure. Similarly, a devotee does not need to endeavor to transfer himself by yoga practice to other planets. Rather, the Supreme Lord, by His great mercy, comes at once, riding on His bird carrier Garuḍa, and at once delivers the devotee from this material existence. Although a man who has fallen in the ocean may struggle very hard and may be very expert in swimming, he cannot save himself. But if someone comes and picks him up from the water, then he is easily rescued. Similarly, the Lord picks up the devotee from this material existence. One simply has to practice the easy process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and fully engage himself in devotional service. Any intelligent man should always prefer the process of devotional service to all other paths. In the Nārāyaṇīya this is confirmed as follows:",
      "yā vai sādhana-sampatti-\npuruṣārtha-catuṣṭaye\n tayā vinā tad-āpnoti\n naro nārāyaṇāśrayaḥ\n",
      "The purport of this verse is that one should not engage in the different processes of fruitive activity or cultivate knowledge by the mental speculative process. One who is devoted to the Supreme Personality can attain all the benefits derived from other yogic processes, speculation, rituals, sacrifices, charities, etc. That is the specific benediction of devotional service.",
      "Simply by chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa-Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare-a devotee of the Lord can approach the supreme destination easily and happily, but this destination cannot be approached by any other process of religion.",
      "The conclusion of Bhagavad-gītā is stated in the Eighteenth Chapter:",
      "sarva-dharmān parityajya\n mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja\n ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo\n mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ.\n",
      "One should give up all other processes of self-realization and simply execute devotional service in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That will enable one to reach the highest perfection of life. There is no need for one to consider the sinful actions of his past life because the Supreme Lord fully takes charge of him. Therefore one should not futilely try to deliver himself in spiritual realization. Let everyone take shelter of the supreme omnipotent Godhead Kṛṣṇa. That is the highest perfection of life."

In this material existence, I may be engaged in some service to some master, but I don\u2019t really lovingly serve my master. I simply serve to get some money. And the master also is not in love; he takes service from me and pays me. So there is no question of love. But for spiritual life, one must be elevated to the pure stage of love.

      "One who is not able even to practice the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga, under the guidance of a spiritual master, can still be drawn to this perfectional stage by working for the Supreme Lord. How to do this work has already been explained in the fifty-fifth verse of the Eleventh Chapter. One should be sympathetic to the propagation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. There are many devotees who are engaged in the propagation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and they require help. So, even if one cannot directly practice the regulated principles of bhakti-yoga, he can try to help such work. Every endeavor requires land, capital, organization, and labor. Just as, in business, one requires a place to stay, some capital to use, some labor, and some organization to expand, so the same is required in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The only difference is that in materialism one works for sense gratification. The same work, however, can be performed for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that is spiritual activity. If one has sufficient money, he can help in building an office or temple for propagating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Or he can help with publications. There are various fields of activity, and one should be interested in such activities. If one cannot sacrifice the result of such activities, the same person can still sacrifice some percentage to propagate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This voluntary service to the cause of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness will help one to rise to a higher state of love for God, whereupon one becomes perfect.\u00a0"

      "It may be that one is unable to even sympathize with the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness because of social, familial or religious considerations or because of some other impediments. If one attaches himself directly to the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there may be objection from family members, or so many other difficulties. For one who has such a problem, it is advised that he sacrifice the accumulated result of his activities to some good cause. Such procedures are described in the Vedic rules. There are many descriptions of sacrifices and special functions of the pumundi or special work in which the result of one\u2019s previous action may be applied. Thus one may gradually become elevated to the state of knowledge. It is also found that when one who is not even interested in the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness gives charity to some hospital or some other social institution, he gives up the hard-earned results of his activities. That is also recommended here because by the practice of giving up the fruits of one\u2019s activities one is sure to purify his mind gradually, and in that purified stage of mind one becomes able to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Of course K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is not dependant on any other experience because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness itself can purify one\u2019s mind, but if there are impediments to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one may try to give up the result of his action. In that respect, social service, community service, national service, sacrifice for one\u2019s country, etc., may be accepted so that some day one may come to the stage of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we find it is stated: yata\u1e25 prav\u1e5bttir bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m: If one decides to sacrifice for the supreme cause, even if he does not know that the supreme cause is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he will come gradually to understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme cause by the sacrificial method.\u00a0"

      "As mentioned in the previous verses, there are two kinds of devotional service: the way of regulated principles, and the way of full attachment in love to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For those who are actually not able to follow the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, it is better to cultivate knowledge because by knowledge one can be able to understand his real position. Gradually knowledge will develop to the point of meditation. By meditation one can be able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by a gradual process. There are processes which make one understand that one himself is the Supreme, and that sort of meditation is preferred if one is unable to engage in devotional service. If one is not able to meditate in such a way, then there are prescribed duties, as enjoined in the Vedic literature, for the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, vai\u015byas, and \u015b\u016bdras, which we shall find in a later chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. But in all cases, one should give up the result or fruits of labor; this means to employ the result of karma for some good cause. In summary, to reach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the highest goal, there are two processes: one process is by gradual development, and the other process is direct. Devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the direct method, and the other method involves renouncing the fruits of one\u2019s activities. Then one can come to the stage of knowledge, then to the stage of meditation, then to the stage of understanding the Supersoul, and then to the stage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One may either take the step by step process or the direct path. The direct process is not possible for everyone; therefore the indirect process is also good. It is, however, to be understood that the indirect process is not recommended for Arjuna because he is already at the stage of loving devotional service to the Supreme Lord. It is for others who are not at this state; for them the gradual process of renunciation, knowledge, meditation and realization of the Supersoul and Brahman should be followed. But as far as Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is concerned, it is the direct method that is stressed. Everyone is advised to take to the direct method and surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u00a0"

      "Coming again to the point of pure devotional service, the Lord is describing the transcendental qualifications of a pure devotee in these two verses. A pure devotee is never disturbed in any circumstances. Nor is he envious of anyone. Nor does a devotee become his enemy’s enemy; he thinks that one is acting as his enemy due to his own past misdeeds. Thus it is better to suffer than to protest. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it is stated: tat te ‘nukampāṁ su-samīkṣyamaṇo. Whenever a devotee is in distress or has fallen into difficulty, he thinks that it is the Lord’s mercy upon him. He thinks: “Thanks to my past misdeeds I should suffer far, far greater than I am suffering now. So it is by the mercy of the Supreme Lord that I am not getting all the punishment I am due. I am just getting a little, by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” Therefore he is always calm, quiet and patient, despite many distressful conditions. A devotee is also always kind to everyone, even to his enemy. Nirmama means that a devotee does not attach much importance to the peace and trouble pertaining to the body because he knows perfectly well that he is not the material body. He does not identify with the body; therefore he is freed from the conception of false ego and is equiposed both in happiness and distress. He is tolerant, and he is satisfied with whatever comes by the grace of the Supreme Lord. He does not endeavor much to achieve something with great difficulty; therefore he is always joyful. He is a completely perfect mystic because he is fixed in the instructions received from the spiritual master, and because his senses are controlled, he is determined. He is not swayed by false argument because no one can lead him from the fixed determination of devotional service. He is fully conscious that Kṛṣṇa is the eternal Lord, so no one can disturb him. All his qualifications enable him to depend entirely on the Supreme Lord. Such a standard of devotional service is undoubtably very rare, but a devotee becomes situated in that stage by following the regulative principles of devotional service. Furthermore, the Lord says that such a devotee is very dear to Him, for the Lord is always pleased with all his activities in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness."

Actually because a devotee is always engrossed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and engaged in devotional service, all such material circumstances cannot woo him. Generally a materialistic person becomes very happy when there is something for his sense gratification and his body, but when he sees that others have something for their sense gratification and he hasn\u2019t, he is sorry and envious. When he is expecting some retaliation from an enemy, he is in a state of fear, and when he cannot successfully execute something he becomes dejected. But a devotee is always transcendental to all these disturbances; therefore he is very dear to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u00a0"

      "A devotee is always free from all bad association. Sometimes one is praised and sometimes one is defamed; that is the nature of human society. But a devotee is always transcendental to artificial fame and infamy, distress or happiness. He is very patient. He does not speak of anything but the topics about Kṛṣṇa; therefore he is called silent. Silent does not mean that one should not speak; silent means that one should not speak nonsense. One should speak only of essentials, and the most essential speech for the devotee is to speak of the Supreme Lord. He is happy in all conditions; sometimes he may get very palatable foodstuffs, sometimes not, but he is satisfied. Nor does he care for any residential facility. He may sometimes live underneath a tree, and he may sometimes live in a very palatial building; he is attracted to neither. He is called fixed because he is fixed in his determination and knowledge. We may find some repetition in the descriptions of the qualifications of a devotee, but this is just to give an illustration of the fact that a devotee must acquire all these qualifications. Without good qualifications, one cannot be a pure devotee. One who is not a devotee has no good qualification. One who wants to be recognized as a devotee should develop the good qualifications. Of course he does not extraneously endeavor to acquire these qualifications, but engagement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and devotional service automatically helps him develop them."

      "In this chapter the religion of eternal engagement, the explanation of the process of transcendental service for approaching the Supreme Lord, is given. This process is very dear to the Lord, and He accepts a person who is engaged in such a process. The question who is better— one who is engaged in the path of impersonal Brahman or one who is engaged in the personal service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead— was raised by Arjuna, and the Lord replied to him so explicitly that there is no doubt that devotional service to the Personality of Godhead is the best of all processes of spiritual realization. In other words, in this chapter it is decided that through good association, one develops attachment for pure devotional service and thereby accepts a bona fide spiritual master and from him begins to hear and chant and observe the regulative principles of devotional service with faith, attachment and devotion and thus becomes engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. This path is recommended in this chapter; therefore there is no doubt that devotional service is the only absolute path for self-realization, for the attainment of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The impersonal conception of the Supreme Absolute Truth, as described in this chapter, is recommended only up to the time one surrenders himself for self-realization. In other words, as long as one does not have the chance to associate with a pure devotee, the impersonal conception may be beneficial. In the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth one works without fruitive result, meditates and cultivates knowledge to understand spirit and matter. This is necessary as long as one is not in the association of a pure devotee. Fortunately, if one develops directly a desire to engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in pure devotional service, he does not need to undergo step by step improvements in spiritual realization. Devotional service, as described in the middle six chapters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, is more congenial. One need not bother about materials to keep body and soul together because by the grace of the Lord everything is carried out automatically.\u00a0",

  "purport": [
      "Arjuna was inquisitive about prakṛti or nature, puruṣa, the enjoyer, kṣetra, the field, kṣetrajña, its knower, and of knowledge and the object of knowledge. When he inquired about all these, Kṛṣṇa said that this body is called the field and that one who knows this body is called the knower of the field. This body is the field of activity for the conditioned soul. The conditioned soul is entrapped in material existence, and he attempts to lord over material nature. And so, according to his capacity to dominate material nature, he gets a field of activity. That field of activity is the body. And what is the body? The body is made of senses. The conditioned soul wants to enjoy sense gratification, and, according to his capacity to enjoy sense gratification, he is offered a body, or field of activity. Therefore the body is called kṣetra, or the field of activity for the conditioned soul. Now, the person who does not identify himself with the body is called kṣetrajña, the knower of the field. It is not very difficult to understand the difference between the field and its knower, the body and the knower of the body. Any person can consider that from childhood to old age he undergoes so many changes of body and yet is still one person, remaining. Thus there is a difference between the knower of the field of activities and the actual field of activities. A living conditioned soul can thus understand that he is different from the body. It is described in the beginning-dehe ‘smin-that the living entity is within the body and that the body is changing from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and from youth to old age, and the person who owns the body knows that the body is changing. The owner is distinctly kṣetrajña. Sometimes we understand that I am happy, I am mad, I am a woman, I am a dog, I am a cat: these are the knowers. The knower is different from the field. Although we use many articles-our clothes, etc.-we know that we are different from the things used. Similarly, we also understand by a little contemplation that we are different from the body.",
      "In the first six chapters of Bhagavad-gītā, the knower of the body, the living entity, and the position by which he can understand the Supreme Lord are described. In the middle six chapters of the Gītā, the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the relationship between the individual soul and the Supersoul in regard to devotional service are described. The superior position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the subordinate position of the individual soul are definitely defined in these chapters. The living entities are subordinate under all circumstances, but in their forgetfulness they are suffering. When enlightened by pious activities, they approach the Supreme Lord in different capacities-as the distressed, those in want of money, the inquisitive, and those in search of knowledge. That is also described. Now, starting with the Thirteenth Chapter, how the living entity comes into contact with material nature, how he is delivered by the Supreme Lord through the different methods of fruitive activities, cultivation of knowledge, and the discharge of devotional service are explained. Although the living entity is completely different from the material body, he somehow becomes related. This also is explained."

In every field of activities, in every body, there are two souls: the individual soul and the Supersoul. Because the Supersoul is the plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cI am also the knower, but I am not the individual owner of the body. I am the superknower. I am present in every body as the Param\u0101tm\u0101, or Supersoul.\u201d\u00a0",
      "One who studies the subject matter of the field of activity and the knower of the field very minutely, in terms of this Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, can attain to knowledge.\u00a0",
      "The Lord says: \u201cI am the knower of the field of activities in every individual body.\u201d The individual may be the knower of his own body, but he is not in knowledge of other bodies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present as the Supersoul in all bodies, knows everything about all bodies. He knows all the different bodies of all the various species of life. A citizen may know everything about his patch of land, but the king knows not only his palace but all the properties possessed by the individual citizens. Similarly, one may be the proprietor of the body individually, but the Supreme Lord is the proprietor of all bodies. The king is the original proprietor of the kingdom, and the citizen is the secondary proprietor. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the supreme proprietor of all bodies.\u00a0",
      "The body consists of the senses. The Supreme Lord is H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, which means controller of the senses. He is the original controller of the senses, just as the king is the original controller of all the activities of the state, and the citizens are secondary controllers. The Lord also says: \u201cI am also the knower.\u201d This means that He is the superknower; the individual soul knows only his particular body. In the Vedic literature, it is stated as follows:\u00a0",
      "kṣetrāṇi hi śarīrāṇi bījaṁ cāpi śubhāśubhe \n tāni vetti sa yogātmā tataḥ kṣetrajña ucyate.",
      "This body is called the k\u1e63etra, and within it dwells the owner of the body and the Supreme Lord who knows both the body and the owner of the body. Therefore He is called the knower of all fields. The distinction between the field of activities, the owner of activities and the supreme owner of activities is described as follows. Perfect knowledge of the constitution of the body, the constitution of the individual soul, and the constitution of the Supersoul is known in terms of Vedic literature as j\u00f1\u0101nam. That is the opinion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. To understand both the soul and the Supersoul as one yet distinct is knowledge. One who does not understand the field of activity and the knower of activity is not in perfect knowledge. One has to understand the position of prak\u1e5bti, nature, and puru\u1e63a, the enjoyer of the nature, and \u012b\u015bvara, the knower who dominates or controls nature and the individual soul. One should not confuse the three in their different capacities. One should not confuse the painter, the painting and the easel. This material world, which is the field of activities, is nature, and the enjoyer of nature is the living entity, and above them both is the supreme controller, the Personality of Godhead. It is stated in the Vedic language: \u201cbhokt\u0101 bhogya\u1e41 prerit\u0101ra\u1e41 ca matv\u0101 sarva\u1e41 prokta\u1e41 tri-vidha\u1e41 brahmam etat.\u201d There are three Brahman conceptions: prak\u1e5bti is Brahman as the field of activities, and the j\u012bva (individual soul) is also Brahman and is trying to control material nature, and the controller of both of them is also Brahman, but He is the factual controller.\u00a0",
      "In this chapter it will be also explained that out of the two knowers, one is fallible and the other is infallible. One is superior and the other is subordinate. One who understands the two knowers of the field to be one and the same contradicts the Supreme Personality of Godhead who states here very clearly that \u201cI am also the knower of the field of activity.\u201d One who misunderstands a rope to be a serpent is not in knowledge. There are different kinds of bodies, and there are different owners of the bodies. Because each individual soul has his individual capacity of lording it over material nature, there are different bodies. But the Supreme also is present in them as the controller. The word ca is significant, for it indicates the total number of bodies. That is the opinion of \u015ar\u012bla Baladeva Vidy\u0101bh\u016b\u1e63a\u1e47a: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supersoul present in each and every body apart from the individual soul. And K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explicitly says here that the Supersoul is the controller of both the field of activities and the finite enjoyer.\u00a0"

One has to know how this body is constituted, the materials of which this body is made, under whose control this body is working, how the changes are taking place, wherefrom the changes are coming, what the causes are, what the reasons are, what the ultimate goal of the individual is, and what the actual form of the individual soul is. One should also know the distinction between the individual living soul and the Supersoul, the different influences, their potentials, etc. One just has to understand this Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 directly from the description given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and all this will be clarified. But one should be careful not to consider the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every body and individual soul to be the j\u012bva.

      "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the highest authority in explaining this knowledge. Still, as a matter of course, learned scholars and standard authorities always give evidence from previous authorities. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is explaining this most controversial point regarding the duality and non-duality of the soul and the Supersoul by referring to Scriptures, the Ved\u0101nta, which are accepted as authority. First, He says, this is according to different sages. As far as the sages are concerned, besides Himself, Vy\u0101sadeva, the author of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, is a great sage, and in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra duality is perfectly explained. And Vy\u0101sadeva\u2019s father, Par\u0101\u015bara, was also a great sage, and he writes in his books of religiosity: \u201caham tva\u1e41 ca ath\u0101nye\u2026\u201d \u201cWe— you, I and various other living entities— are all transcendental, although in material bodies. Now we are fallen into the ways of the three modes of material nature according to our different karma. As such, some are on higher levels, and some are in the lower nature. The higher and lower natures exist due to ignorance and are being manifested in an infinite number of living entities. But the Supersoul, which is infallible, is uncontaminated by the three qualities of nature and is transcendental.\u201d Similarly, in the original Vedas, a distinction between the soul, the Supersoul and the body is made, especially in the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad.\u00a0",
      "There is a manifestation of the Supreme Lord\u2019s energy known as annamaya by which one depends simply upon food for existence. This is a materialistic realization of the Supreme. Then there is pr\u0101\u1e47amaya; this means that after realizing the Supreme Absolute Truth in foodstuff, one can realize the Absolute Truth in the living symptoms, or life forms. In j\u00f1\u0101namaya the living symptom develops to the point of thinking, feeling, and willing. Then there is Brahman realization and the realization called vij\u00f1\u0101namaya by which the living entity\u2019s mind and life symptoms are distinguished from the living entity himself. The next and supreme stage is \u0101nandamaya, realization of the all-blissful nature. Thus there are five stages of Brahman realization, which is called brahma puccham. Out of these the first three— annamaya, pr\u0101\u1e47amaya, and j\u00f1\u0101namaya-involve the fields of activities of the living entities. Transcendental to all these fields of activities is the Supreme Lord, who is called \u0101nandamaya. In the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra also the Supreme is called \u0101nandamayo \u2018bhy\u0101s\u0101t. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is by nature full of joy, and to enjoy His transcendental bliss, He expands into vij\u00f1\u0101namaya, pr\u0101\u1e47amaya, j\u00f1\u0101namaya, and annamaya. In this field of activities the living entity is considered to be the enjoyer, and different from him is the \u0101nandamaya. That means that if the living entity decides to enjoy, in dovetailing himself with the \u0101nandamaya, then he becomes perfect. This is the real picture of the Supreme Lord, as supreme knower of the field, the living entity, as subordinate knower, and the nature of the field of activities.\u00a0"

      "From all the authoritative statements of the great sages, the Vedic hymns and the aphorisms of the Vedānta-sūtra, the components of this world are earth, water, fire, air and ether. These are the five great elements (mahābhūta). Then there are false ego, intelligence and the unmanifested stage of the three modes of nature. Then there are five senses for acquiring knowledge: the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and touch. Then five working senses: voice, legs, hands, the anus and the genitals. Then, above the senses, there is the mind, which is within and which can be called the sense within. Therefore, including the mind, there are eleven senses altogether. Then there are the five objects of the senses: smell, taste, warmth, touch and sound. Now the aggregate of these twenty-four elements is called the field of activity. If one makes an analytical study of these twenty-four subjects, then he can very well understand the field of activity. Then there is desire, hatred, pleasure and pain, which are interactions, representations of the five great elements in the gross body. The living symptoms, represented by consciousness and conviction, are the manifestation of the subtle body-mind, ego and intelligence. These subtle elements are included within the field of activities.",
      "The five great elements are a gross representation of the subtle false ego. They are a representation in the material conception. Consciousness is represented by intelligence, of which the unmanifested stage is the three modes of material nature. The unmanifested three modes of material nature is called pradhāna.",
      "One who desires to know the twenty-four elements in detail along with their interactions should study the philosophy in more detail. In Bhagavad-gītā, a summary only is given.",
      "The body is the representation of all these factors, and there are changes of the body, which are six in number: the body is born, it grows, it stays, it produces by-products, then begins to decay, and at the last stage it vanishes. Therefore the field is a nonpermanent material thing. However, the kṣetrajña, the knower of the field, its proprietor, is different."

",
  "purport": [
      "This process of knowledge is sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent men as being the interaction of the field of activity. But actually this is the real process of knowledge. If one accepts this process, then the possibility of approaching the Absolute Truth exists. This is not the interaction of the tenfold elements, as described before, This is actually the means to get out of it. Of all the descriptions of the process of knowledge, the most important point is described in the first line of the tenth verse: The process of knowledge terminates in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord. So, if one does not approach, or is not able to approach, the transcendental service of the Lord, then the other nineteen items are of no particular value. But, if one takes to devotional service in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the other nineteen items automatically develop within him. The principle of accepting a spiritual master, as mentioned in the seventh verse, is essential. Even for one who takes to devotional service, it is most important. Transcendental life begins when one accepts a bona fide spiritual master. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, clearly states here that this process of knowledge is the actual path. Anything speculated beyond this is nonsense.",
      "As for the knowledge outlined here, the items may be analyzed as follows: Humility means that one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being honored by others. The material conception of life makes us very eager to receive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect knowledge-who knows that he is not this body-anything, honor or dishonor, pertaining to this body is useless. One should not be hankering after this material deception. People are very anxious to be famous for their religion, and consequently sometimes it is found that without understanding the principles of religion, one enters into some group, which is not actually following religious principles, and then wants to advertise himself as a religious mentor. As for actual advancement in spiritual science, one should have a test to see how far he is progressing. He can judge by these items.",
      "Nonviolence is generally taken to mean not killing or destroying the body, but actually nonviolence means not to put others into distress. People in general are trapped by ignorance in the material concept of life, and they perpetually suffer material pains. So, unless one elevates people to spiritual knowledge, one is practicing violence. One should try his best to distribute real knowledge to the people, so that they may become enlightened and leave this material entanglement. That is nonviolence.",
      "Tolerance means that one should be practiced to bear insult and dishonor from others. If one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge, there will be so many insults and much dishonor from others. This is expected because material nature is so constituted. Even a boy like Prahlāda, who, only five years old, was engaged in the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, was endangered when his father became antagonistic to his devotion. The father tried to kill him in so many ways, but Prahlada tolerated him. So, for making advancement in spiritual knowledge, there may be many impediments, but we should be tolerant and continue our progress with determination.",
      "Simplicity means that without diplomacy one should be so straightforward that he can disclose the real truth even to an enemy. As for acceptance of the spiritual master, that is essential, because without the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master, one cannot progress in the spiritual science. One should approach the spiritual master with all humility and offer him all services so that he will be pleased to bestow his blessings upon the disciple. Because a bona fide spiritual master is a representative of Kṛṣṇa, if he bestows any blessings upon his disciple, that will make the disciple immediately advanced without the disciple’s following the regulated principles. Or, the regulated principles will be easier for one who has served the spiritual master without reservation.",
      "Cleanliness is essential for making advancement in spiritual life. There are two kinds of cleanliness: external and internal. External cleanliness means taking a bath, but for internal cleanliness, one has to think of Kṛṣṇa always and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/Hare Rāma. Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma Hare Hare. This process cleans the accumulated dust of past karma from the mind.",
      "Steadiness means that one should be very determined to make progress in spiritual life. Without such determination, one cannot make tangible progress. And self-control means that one should not accept anything which is detrimental to the path of spiritual progress. One should become accustomed to this and reject anything which is against the path of spiritual progress. This is real renunciation. The senses are so strong that they are always anxious to have sense gratification. One should not cater to these demands, which are not necessary. The senses should only be gratified to keep the body fit so that one can discharge his duty in advancing in spiritual life. The most important and uncontrollable sense is the tongue. If one can control the tongue, then there is every possibility of controlling the other senses. The function of the tongue is to taste and to vibrate. Therefore, by systematic regulation, the tongue should always be engaged in tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kṛṣṇa and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. As far as the eyes are concerned, they should not be allowed to see anything but the beautiful form of Kṛṣṇa. That will control the eyes. Similarly, the ears should be engaged in hearing about Kṛṣṇa and the nose in smelling the flowers offered to Kṛṣṇa. This is the process of devotional service, and it is understood here that Bhagavad-gītā is simply expounding the science of devotional service. Devotional service is the main and sole objective. Unintelligent commentators on the Gītā try to divert the mind of the reader to other subjects, but there is no other subject in Bhagavad-gītā but devotional service.",
      "False ego means accepting this body as oneself. When one understands that he is not his body and is spirit soul, that is real ego. Ego is there. False ego is condemned, but not real ego. In the Vedic literature, it is said: ahaṁ brahmāsmi. I am Brahman, I am spirit. This “I am,” the sense of self, also exists in the liberated stage of self-realization. This sense of “I am” is ego, but when the sense of “I am” is applied to this false body, it is false ego. When the sense of self is applied to reality, that is real ego. There are some philosophers who say we should give up our ego, but we cannot give up our ego because ego means identity. We ought, of course, to give up the false identification with the body.",
      "One should try to understand the distress of accepting birth, death, old age and disease. There are descriptions in various Vedic literatures of birth. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam the world of the unborn, the child’s stay in the womb of the mother, its suffering, etc., are all very graphically described. It should be thoroughly understood that birth is distressful. Because we forget how much distress we have suffered within the womb of the mother, we do not make any solution to the repetition of birth and death. Similarly at the time of death, there are all kinds of sufferings, and they are also mentioned in the authoritative scriptures. These should be discussed. And as far as disease and old age are concerned, everyone gets practical experience. No one wants to be diseased, and no one wants to become old, but there is no avoiding these. Unless we have a pessimistic view of this material life, considering the distresses of birth, death, old age and disease, there is no impetus for our making advancement in spiritual life.",
      "As for detachment from children, wife and home, it is not meant that one should have no feeling for these. They are natural objects of affection, but when they are not favorable to spiritual progress, then one should not be attached to them. The best process for making the home pleasant is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If one is in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he can make his home very happy because this process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is very easy. One need only chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kṛṣṇa, have some discussion on books like Bhagavad-gītā and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, and engage oneself in Deity worship. These four will make one happy. One should train the members of his family in this way. The family members can sit down morning and evening and chant together Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. If one can mold his family life in this way to develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness, following these four principles, then there is no need to change from family life to renounced life. But if it is not congenial, not favorable for spiritual advancement, then family life should be abandoned. One must sacrifice everything to realize or serve Kṛṣṇa, just as Arjuna did. Arjuna did not want to kill his family members, but when he understood that these family members were impediments to his Kṛṣṇa realization, he accepted the instruction of Kṛṣṇa and fought and killed them. In all cases, one should be detached from the happiness and distress of family life because in this world one can never be fully happy or fully miserable. Happiness and distress are concommitant factors of material life. One should learn to tolerate, as advised in Bhagavad-gītā. One can never restrict the coming and going of happiness and distress, so one should be detached from the materialistic way of life and be automatically equiposed in both cases. Generally, when we get something desirable, we are very happy, and when we get something undesirable, we are distressed. But if we are actually in the spiritual position, these things will not agitate us. To reach that stage, we have to practice unbreakable devotional service; devotional service to Kṛṣṇa without deviation means engaging oneself in the nine processes of devotional service, chanting, hearing, worshiping, offering respect, etc., as described in the last verse of the Ninth Chapter. That process should be followed. Naturally, when one is adapted to the spiritual way of life, he will not want to mix with materialistic men. That would go against his grain. One may test himself by seeing how far he is inclined to live in a solitary place without unwanted association.",
      "Naturally a devotee has no taste for unnecessary sporting or cinema-going or enjoying some social function, because he understands that these are simply a waste of time. There are many research scholars and philosophers who study sex life or some other subject, but according to Bhagavad-gītā, such research work and philosophical speculation have no value. That is more or less nonsensical. According to Bhagavad-gītā, one should make research by philosophical discretion into the nature of the soul. One should make research to understand with what the self is concerned. That is recommended here.",
      "As far as self-realization is concerned, it is clearly stated here that bhakti-yoga is especially practical. As soon as there is a question of devotion, one must consider the relationship between the Supersoul and the individual soul. The individual soul and the Supersoul cannot be one, at least not in the bhakti conception, the devotional conception of life. This service of the individual soul to the Supreme Soul is eternal, nityam, as is clearly stated. So bhakti or devotional service is eternal. One should be established in that philosophical conviction, otherwise it is only a waste of time, ignorance.",
      "In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, this is explained; vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam. “Those who are actually knowers of the Absolute Truth know that the Self is realized in three different phases as Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān.” (Bhāg. 1.2.11) Bhagavān is the last word in the realization of the Absolute Truth; therefore one should reach up to that platform of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus engage in the devotional service of the Lord. That is perfection of knowledge.",
      "Beginning from practicing humility up to the point of realization of the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, this process is just like a staircase beginning from the ground floor up to the top floor. Now on this staircase there are so many people who have reached the first floor, the second or third floor, etc., but unless one reaches the top floor, which is the understanding of Kṛṣṇa, he is at a lower stage of knowledge. If anyone wants to compete with God and at the same time make advancement in spiritual knowledge, he will be frustrated. It is clearly stated that without humility understanding is harmful. To think oneself God is most puffed up. Although the living entity is always being kicked by the stringent laws of material nature, still he thinks, “I am God” because of ignorance. One should be humble and know that he is subordinate to the Supreme Lord. Due to rebellion against the Supreme Lord, one becomes subordinate to material nature. One must know and be convinced of this truth"

      "The Lord has explained the field of activities and the knower of the field. He has also explained the process of knowing the knower of the field of activities. Now He is explaining the knowable, both the soul and the Supersoul respectively. By knowledge of the knower, both the soul and the Supersoul, one can relish the nectar of life. As explained in the Second Chapter, the living entity is eternal. This is also confirmed here. There is no specific date at which the j\u012bva was born. Nor can anyone trace out the history of j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101\u2019s manifestation from the Supreme Lord. Therefore it is beginningless. The Vedic literature confirms this: na j\u0101yate m\u1e5bjayate v\u0101 vipa\u015bcit. The knower of the body is never born and never dies, and he is full of knowledge. The Supreme Lord is also stated in the Vedic literature as pradh\u0101na-k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a-patir gu\u1e47e\u015ba\u1e25. The Supreme Lord as the Supersoul is the chief knower of the body, and He is the master of the three modes of material nature. In the sm\u1e5bti it is said: d\u0101sa-bh\u016bto harer eva n\u0101nyasvaiva kad\u0101cana. The living entities are eternally in the service of the Supreme Lord. This is also confirmed by Lord Caitanya in His teaching; therefore the description of Brahman mentioned in this verse is in relation to the individual soul, and when the word Brahman is applied to the living entity, it is to be understood that he is vij\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 brahma as opposed to ananta-brahma. Ananta-brahma is the Supreme Brahman Personality of Godhead.\u00a0"

      "As the sun exists diffusing its unlimited rays, so does the Supersoul, or Supreme Personality of Godhead. He exists in His all-pervading form, and in Him exist all the individual living entities, beginning from the first great teacher, Brahm\u0101, down to the small ants. There are unlimited heads, legs, hands and eyes, and unlimited living entities. All are existing in and on the Supersoul. Therefore the Supersoul is all-pervading. The individual soul, however, cannot say that he has his hands, legs and eyes everywhere. That is not possible. If he thinks that although under ignorance he is not conscious that his hands and legs are diffused all over, but when he attains to proper knowledge he will come to that stage, his thinking is contradictory. This means that the individual soul, having become conditioned by material nature, is not supreme. The Supreme is different from the individual soul. The Supreme Lord can extend His hand without limit; the individual soul cannot. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says that if anyone offers Him a flower, or a fruit, or a little water, He accepts. If the Lord is a far distance away, how can He accept things? This is the omnipotence of the Lord: even though He is situated in His own abode, far, far away from earth, He can extend His hand to accept what anyone offers. That is His potency. In the Brahm\u0101-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is stated, goloka eva nivasati: although He is always engaged in pastimes in His transcendental planet, He is all-pervading. The individual soul cannot claim that he is all-pervading. Therefore this verse describes the Supreme Soul, the Personality of Godhead, not the individual soul.\u00a0"

  "purport": [
      "The Supreme Lord, although the source of all the senses of the living entities, doesn\u2019t have material senses like they have. Actually, the individual souls have spiritual senses, but in condemned life they are covered with the material elements and therefore the sense activities are exhibited through matter. The Supreme Lord\u2019s senses are not so covered. His senses are transcendental and are therefore called nirgu\u1e47a. Gu\u1e47a means the material modes, but His senses are without material covering. It should be understood that His senses are not exactly like ours. Although He is the source of all our sensual activities, He has His transcendental senses which are uncontaminated. This is very nicely explained in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad in the verse: sarvata\u1e25 p\u0101\u1e47i-p\u0101dam. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no hands which are materially contaminated, but He has His hands and accepts whatever sacrifice is offered to Him. That is the distinction between the conditioned soul and the Supersoul. He has no material eyes, but He has eyes-otherwise how could He see? He sees everything, past, present and future. He lives within the heart of the living being, and He knows what we have done in the past, what we are doing now, and what is awaiting us in the future. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: He knows everything, but no one knows Him. It is said that the Supreme Lord has no legs like us, but He can travel throughout space because He has spiritual legs. In other words, the Lord is not impersonal; He has His eyes, legs, hands and everything else, and because we are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord we also have these things. But His hands, legs, eyes and senses are not contaminated by material nature.\u00a0",
      "Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also confirms that when the Lord appears He appears as He is by His internal potency. He is not contaminated by the material energy because He is the Lord of material energy. In the Vedic literature we find that His whole embodiment is spiritual. He has His eternal form called sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha. He is full of all opulence. He is the proprietor of all wealth and the owner of all energy. He is the most intelligent and is full of knowledge. These are some of the symptoms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is maintainer of all living entities and the witness of all activities. As far as we can understand from Vedic literature, the Supreme Lord is always transcendental. Although we do not see His head, face, hands, or legs, He has them, and when we are elevated to the transcendental situation then we can see the Lord\u2019s form. Due to materially contaminated senses, we cannot see His form. Therefore the impersonalists who are still materially affected cannot understand the Personality of Godhead.\u00a0"

In the material world that brahmajyoti the Lord\u2019s spiritual effulgence, is covered by the mahat-tattva, the material elements; therefore in this material world we require the assistance of sun, moon, electricity, etc., for light. But in the spiritual world there is no need of such things. It is clearly stated in the Vedic literature that because of His luminous effulgence, everything is illuminated. It is clear, therefore, that His situation is not in the material world. He is situated in the spiritual world which is far, far away in the spiritual sky. That is also confirmed in the Vedic literature. \u0100ditya-var\u1e47am tamasa\u1e25 parast\u0101t. He is just like the sun, eternally luminous, but He is far, far beyond the darkness of this material world. His knowledge is transcendental. The Vedic literature confirms that Brahman is concentrated transcendental knowledge.

The Supreme has legs and hands distributed everywhere, and this cannot be said of the individual soul. Therefore that there are two knowers of the field of activity, the individual soul and the Supersoul, must be admitted. One\u2019s hands and legs are distributed locally, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s hands and legs are distributed everywhere.

Material nature was absorbed in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mah\u0101-Vis\u1e47u, and when it was required, it was manifested by the agency of mahat-tattva. Similarly, the living entities are also in Him, and because they are conditioned, they are adverse to serving the Supreme Lord. Thus they are not allowed to enter into the spiritual sky. After the winding up of material nature, these living entities are again given a chance to act in the material world and prepare themselves to enter into the spiritual world. That is the mystery of this material creation. Actually the living entity is originally the spiritual part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but due to his rebellious nature, he is conditioned within material nature. It really does not matter how these living entities or superior entities of the Supreme Lord have come in contact with material nature. The Supreme Personality of Godhead knows, however, how and why this actually took place. In the scriptures the Lord says that those attracted by this material nature are undergoing a hard struggle for existence. But we should know it with certainty from the descriptions of these few verses that all the transformations and influences of material nature by the three modes are also productions of material nature. All transformations and variety in respect to living entities are due to the body. As far as spirit is concerned, living entities are all the same.\u00a0"

      "The different manifestations of body and senses among the living entities are due to material nature. There are 8,400,000 different species of life, and these varieties are the creation of the material nature. They arise from the different sensual pleasures of the living entity, who thus desires to live in this body or that. When he is put into different bodies, he enjoys different kinds of happiness and distress. His material happiness and distress are due to his body, and not to himself as he is. In his original state there is no doubt of enjoyment; therefore that is his real state. Because of the desire to lord it over material nature, he is in the material world. In the spiritual world there is no such thing. The spiritual world is pure, but in the material world everyone is struggling hard to acquire victims who present different pleasures to the body. It might be more clear to state that this body is the effect of the senses. The senses are instruments for gratifying desire. Now, the sum total-body and instrument senses-are offered by material nature, and, as will be clear in the next verse, the living entity is blessed or damned with circumstances according to his past desire and activity. According to one\u2019s desires and activities, material nature places one in various residential quarters. The being himself is the cause of his attaining such residential quarters and his attendant enjoyment or suffering. Once placed in some particular kind of body, he comes under the control of nature because the body, being matter, acts according to the laws of nature. At that time, the living entity has no power to change that law. Suppose an entity is put into the body of a dog. As soon as he is put into the body of a dog, he must act like a dog. He cannot act otherwise. And if the living entity is put into the body of a hog, then he is forced to eat stool and act like a hog. Similarly, if the living entity is put into the body of a demigod, he must act according to his body. This is the law of nature. But in all circumstances, the Supersoul is with the individual soul. That is explained in the Vedas as follows: dv\u0101 supar\u1e47\u0101 sayuj\u0101 sakh\u0101y\u0101. The Supreme Lord is so kind upon the living entity that He always accompanies the individual soul and in all circumstances is present as the Supersoul or Param\u0101tm\u0101.\u00a0"

      "This verse is very important for an understanding of how the living entities transmigrate from one body to another. It is explained in the Second Chapter that the living entity is transmigrating from one body to another just as one changes dress. This change of dress is due to his attachment to material existence. As long as he is captivated by this false manifestation, he has to continue transmigrating from one body to another. Due to his desire to lord it over material nature, he is put into such undesirable circumstances. Under the influence of material desire, the entity is born sometimes as a demigod, sometimes as a man, sometimes as a beast, as a bird, as a worm, as an aquatic, as a saintly man, as a bug. This is going on. And in all cases the living entity thinks himself to be the master of his circumstances, yet he is under the influence of material nature.\u00a0",
      "How he is put into such different bodies is explained here. It is due to association with the different modes of nature. One has to rise, therefore, above the three material modes and become situated in the transcendental position. That is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Unless one is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, his material consciousness will oblige him to transfer from one body to another because he has material desires since time immemorial. But he has to change that conception. That change can be effected only by hearing from authoritative sources. The best example is here: Arjuna is hearing the science of God from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The living entity, if he submits to this hearing process, will lose his long-cherished desire to dominate material nature, and gradually and proportionately, as he reduces his long desire to dominate, he comes to enjoy spiritual happiness. In a Vedic mantra it is said that as he becomes learned in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he proportionately relishes his eternal blissful life.\u00a0"

      "It is stated here that the Supersoul, who is always with the individual soul, is the representation of the Supreme Lord. He is not an ordinary living entity. Because the monist philosophers take the knower of the body to be one, they think that there is no difference between the Supersoul and the individual soul. To clarify this, the Lord says that He is the representation of Param\u0101tm\u0101 in every body. He is different from the individual soul; He is para\u1e25, transcendental. The individual soul enjoys the activities of a particular field, but the Supersoul is present not as finite enjoyer nor as one taking part in bodily activities, but as the witness, overseer, permitter and supreme enjoyer. His name is Param\u0101tm\u0101, not \u0101tm\u0101, and He is transcendental. It is distinctly clear that the \u0101tm\u0101 and Param\u0101tm\u0101 are different. The Supersoul, the Param\u0101tm\u0101, has legs and hands everywhere, but the individual soul does not. And because He is the Supreme Lord, He is present within to sanction the individual soul\u2019s desiring material enjoyment. Without the sanction of the Supreme Soul, the individual soul cannot do anything. The individual is bhakta or the sustained, and He is bhukta or the maintainer. There are innumerable living entities, and He is staying in them as a friend.\u00a0",
      "The fact is that individual living entities are eternally part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, and both of them are very intimately related as friends. But the living entity has the tendency to reject the sanction of the Supreme Lord and act independently in an attempt to dominate the supreme nature, and because he has this tendency, he is called the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord. The living entity can be situated either in the material energy or the spiritual energy. As long as he is conditioned by the material energy, the Supreme Lord, as his friend, the Supersoul, stays with him just to get him to return to the spiritual energy. The Lord is always eager to take him back to the spiritual energy, but due to his minute independence, the individual entity is continually rejecting the association of spiritual light. This misuse of independence is the cause of his material strife in the conditioned nature. The Lord, therefore, is always giving instruction from within and from without. From without He gives instructions as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and from within He tries to convince him that his activities in the material field are not conducive to real happiness. \u201cJust give it up and turn your faith toward Me. Then you will be happy,\u201d He says. Thus the intelligent person who places his faith in the Param\u0101tm\u0101 or the Supreme Personality of Godhead begins to advance toward a blissful eternal life of knowledge\u00a0"

      "The Lord informs Arjuna that the conditioned soul can be divided into two classes as far as man\u2019s search for self-realization is concerned. Those who are atheists, agnostics and skeptics are beyond the sense of spiritual understanding. But there are others who are faithful in their understanding of spiritual life, and they are called workers who have renounced fruitive results. Those who always try to establish the doctrine of monism are also counted among the atheists and agnostics. In other words, only the devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are really capable of spiritual understanding because they understand that beyond this material nature there is the spiritual world and the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is expanded as the Param\u0101tm\u0101, the Supersoul in everyone, the all-pervading Godhead. Of course there are those who try to understand the Supreme Absolute Truth by cultivation of knowledge, and they can be counted in the second class. The atheistic philosophers analyze this material world into twenty-four elements, and they place the individual soul as the twenty-fifth item. When they are able to understand the nature of the individual soul to be transcendental to the material elements, they are able to understand also that above the individual soul there is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the twenty-sixth element. Thus gradually they also come to the standard of devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Those who work without fruitive results are also perfect in their attitude. They are given a chance to advance to the platform of devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Here it is stated that there are some people who are pure in consciousness and who try to find out the Supersoul by meditation, and when they discover the Supersoul within themselves, they become transcendentally situated. Similarly, there are others who also try to understand the Supreme Soul by cultivation of knowledge, and there are others who cultivate the ha\u1e6dha-yoga system and who try to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by childish activities.\u00a0"

      "This verse is particularly applicable to modern society because in modern society there is practically no education in spiritual matters. Some of the people may appear to be atheistic or agnostic or philosophical, but actually there is no knowledge of philosophy. As for the common man, if he is a good soul, then there is a chance for advancement by hearing. This hearing process is very important. Lord Caitanya, who preached K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in the modern world, gave great stress to hearing because if the common man simply hears from authoritative sources, he can progress, especially, according to Lord Caitanya, if he hears the transcendental vibration Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. It is stated, therefore, that all men should take advantage of hearing from realized souls and gradually become able to understand everything. The worship of the Supreme Lord will then undoubtedly take place. Lord Caitanya has said that in this age no one needs to change his position, but one should give up the endeavor to understand the Absolute Truth by speculative reasoning. One should learn to become the servant of those who are in knowledge of the Supreme Lord. If one is fortunate enough to take shelter of a pure devotee, hear from him about self-realization and follow in his footsteps, he will be gradually elevated to the position of a pure devotee. In this verse particularly the process of hearing is strongly recommended, and this is very appropriate. Although the common man is often not as capable as so-called philosophers, faithful hearing from an authoritative person will help one transcend this material existence and go back to Godhead, back to home.\u00a0"

A spiritual master teaches his students to get free from the material concept of life by various instructions.

This material world is working by the conjunction of the soul and the twenty-four material elements. One who can see the constitution of the whole material manifestation as this combination of the soul and material elements and also can see the situation of the Supreme Soul becomes eligible for transfer to the spiritual world.

Those who have no knowledge of the spiritual sky hold that after being freed from the material activities of the material form, this spiritual identity becomes formless, without any variegatedness. However, just as there is material variegatedness in this world, so, in the spiritual world, there is also variegatedness. Those in ignorance of this think that spiritual existence is opposed to material variety. But actually, in the spiritual sky, one attains spiritual form. There are spiritual activities, and the spiritual situation is called devotional life. That atmosphere is said to be uncontaminated, and there one is equal in quality with the Supreme Lord. To obtain such knowledge, one must develop all the spiritual qualities. One who thus develops the spiritual qualities is not affected either by the creation or the destruction of the material world.\u00a0"

      "The scorpion lays its eggs in piles of rice, and sometimes it is said that the scorpion is born out of rice. But the rice is not the cause of the scorpion. Actually, the eggs were laid by the mother. Similarly, material nature is not the cause of the birth of the living entities. The seed is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and they only seem to come out as products of material nature. Thus every living entity, according to his past activities, has a different body, created by this material nature, and the entity can enjoy or suffer according to his past deeds. The Lord is the cause of all the manifestations of living entities in this material world.\u00a0"

      "The living entities conditioned by material nature are of various types. One is happy, another is very active, and another is helpless. All these types of psychological manifestations are causes of the entities\u2019 conditioned status in nature. How they are differently conditioned is explained in this section of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The mode of goodness is first considered. The effect of developing the mode of goodness in the material world is that one becomes wiser than those otherwise conditioned. A man in the mode of goodness is not so much affected by material miseries, and he has a sense of advancement in material knowledge. The representative type is the br\u0101hma\u1e47a, who is supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness. This sense of happiness is due to understanding that, in the mode of goodness, one is more or less free from sinful reactions. Actually, in the Vedic literature it is said that the mode of goodness means greater knowledge and a greater sense of happiness.\u00a0",
      "The difficulty here is that when a living entity is situated in the mode of goodness, he becomes conditioned to feel that he is advanced in knowledge and is better than others. In this way he becomes conditioned. The best examples are the scientist and philosopher: each is very proud of his knowledge, and because they generally improve their living conditions, they feel a sort of material happiness. This sense of advanced happiness in conditioned life makes them bound by the mode of goodness of material nature. As such, they are attracted toward working in the mode of goodness, and, as long as they have an attraction for working in that way, they have to take some type of body in the modes of nature. Thus there is no likelihood of liberation, or of being transferred to the spiritual world. Repeatedly, one may become a philosopher, a scientist, or a poet, and, repeatedly, become entangled in the same disadvantages of birth and death. But, due to the illusion of the material energy, one thinks that that sort of life is pleasant.\u00a0"

For sense gratification, a man in the mode of passion wants some honor in society, or in the nation, and he wants to have a happy family, with nice children, wife, and house. These are the products of the mode of passion. As long as one is hankering after these things, he has to work very hard. Therefore it is clearly stated here that he becomes associated with the fruits of his activities and thus becomes bound by such activities. In order to please his wife, children and society and to keep up his prestige, one has to work. Therefore, the whole material world is more or less in the mode of passion. Modern civilization is considered to be advanced in the standards of the mode of passion. Formerly, the advanced condition was considered to be in the mode of goodness.

      "In this verse the specific application of the word tu is very significant. This means that the mode of ignorance is a very peculiar qualification of the embodied soul. This mode of ignorance is just the opposite of the mode of goodness. In the mode of goodness, by development of knowledge, one can understand what is what, but the mode of ignorance is just the opposite. Everyone under the spell of the mode of ignorance becomes mad, and a madman cannot understand what is what. Instead of making advancement, one becomes degraded. The definition of the mode of ignorance is stated in the Vedic literature: under the spell of ignorance, one cannot understand the thing as it is. For example, everyone can see that his grandfather has died, and therefore he will also die; man is mortal. The children that he conceives will also die. So death is sure. Still, people are madly accumulating money and working very hard all day and night, not caring for the eternal spirit. This is madness. In their madness, they are very reluctant to make advancement in spiritual understanding. Such people are very lazy. When they are invited to associate for spiritual understanding, they are not much interested. They are not even active like the man who is controlled by the mode of passion. Thus another symptom of one embedded in the mode of ignorance is that he sleeps more than is required. Six hours of sleep is sufficient, but a man in the mode of ignorance sleeps at least ten or twelve hours a day. Such a man appears to be always dejected, and is addicted to intoxicants and sleeping. These are the symptoms of a person conditioned by the mode of ignorance.\u00a0"

      "By pious activities in the mode of goodness one is purified; therefore the sages, who are free from all illusion, are situated in happiness. Similarly, activities in the mode of passion are simply miserable. Any activity for material happiness is bound to be defeated. If, for example, one wants to have a skyscraper, so much human misery has to be undergone before a big skyscraper can be built. The financier has to take much trouble to earn a mass of wealth, and those who are slaving to construct the building have to render physical toil. The miseries are there. Thus Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 says that in any activity performed under the spell of the mode of passion, there is definitely great misery. There may be a little so-called mental happiness-\u201cI have this house or this money\u201d-but this is not actual happiness. As far as the mode of ignorance is concerned, the performer is without knowledge, and therefore all his activities result in present misery, and afterwards he will go on toward animal life. Animal life is always miserable, although, under the spell of the illusory energy, m\u0101y\u0101, the animals do not understand this. Slaughtering poor animals is also due to the mode of ignorance. The animal killers do not know that in the future the animal will have a body suitable to kill them. That is the law of nature. In human society, if one kills a man he has to be hanged. That is the law of the state. Because of ignorance, people do not perceive that there is a complete state controlled by the Supreme Lord. Every living creature is the son of the Supreme Lord, and He does not tolerate even an ant\u2019s being killed. One has to pay for it. So, indulgence in animal killing for the taste of the tongue is the grossest kind of ignorance. A human being has no need to kill animals because God has supplied so many nice things. If one indulges in meat-eating anyway, it is to be understood that he is acting in ignorance and is making his future very dark. Of all kinds of animal killing, the killing of cows is most vicious because the cow gives us all kinds of pleasure by supplying milk. Cow slaughter is an act of the grossest type of ignorance. In the Vedic literature the words gobhi\u1e25 pr\u012b\u1e47ita-matsaram indicate that one who, being fully satisfied by milk, is desirous of killing the cow, is in the grossest ignorance. There is also a prayer in the Vedic literature that states:\u00a0",
      "namo brahmaṇya-devāya go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca \n jagaddhitāya kṛṣṇāya govindāya namo namaḥ.",
      "\u201cMy Lord, You are the well-wisher of the cows and the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and You are the well-wisher of the entire human society and world.\u201d The purport is that special mention is given in that prayer for the protection of the cows and the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Br\u0101hma\u1e47as are the symbol of spiritual education, and cows are the symbol of the most valuable food; these two living creatures, the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and the cows, must be given all protection-that is real advancement of civilization. In modern human society, spiritual knowledge is neglected, and cow killing is encouraged. It is to be understood, then, that human society is advancing in the wrong direction and is clearing the path to its own condemnation. A civilization which guides the citizens to become animals in their next lives is certainly not a human civilization. The present human civilization is, of course, grossly misled by the modes of passion and ignorance. It is a very dangerous age, and all nations should take care to provide the easiest process, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, to save humanity from the greatest danger.\u00a0"

In the mode of ignorance, for example, they do not see that by killing one animal they are taking a chance of being killed by the same animal in the next life. Because people have no education in actual knowledge, they become irresponsible. To stop this irresponsibility, education for developing the mode of goodness of the people in general must be there.

      "In this verse the results of actions in the three modes of nature are more explicitly set forth. There is an upper planetary system, consisting of the heavenly planets, where everyone is highly elevated. According to the degree of development of the mode of goodness, the living entity can be transferred to various planets in this system. The highest planet is Satyaloka, or Brahmaloka, where the prime person of this universe, Lord Brahm\u0101, resides. We have seen already that we can hardly calculate the wondrous condition of life in Brahmaloka, but the highest condition of life, the mode of goodness, can bring us to this.\u00a0",

A person is not always pure, but even if he should be purely in the mode of passion, he will simply remain on this earth as a king or a rich man. But because there are mixtures, one can also go down. People on this earth, in the modes of passion or ignorance, cannot forcibly approach the higher planets by machine. In the mode of passion, there is also the chance of becoming mad in the next life.\u00a0",
      "The lowest quality, the mode of ignorance, is described here as abominable. The result of developing ignorance is very, very risky. It is the lowest quality in material nature. Beneath the human level there are eight million species of life: birds, beasts, reptiles, trees, etc., and, according to the development of the mode of ignorance, people are brought down to these abominable conditions.

Actually, the living entity is not the performer of different activities. He is forced to act because he is situated in a particular type of body, conducted by some particular mode of material nature.

  "purport": [
      "Arjuna submitted the three different questions, and the Lord answers them one after another. In these verses, Kṛṣṇa first indicates that a person transcendentally situated neither envies anyone nor hankers for anything. When a living entity stays in this material world embodied by the material body, it is to be understood that he is under the control of one of the three modes of material nature. When he is actually out of the body, then he is out of the clutches of the material modes of nature. But as long as he is not out of the material body, he should be neutral. He should engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord so that his identity with the material body will automatically be forgotten. When one is conscious of the material body, he acts only for sense gratification, but when one transfers the consciousness to Kṛṣṇa, sense gratification automatically stops. One does not need this material body, and he does not need to accept the dictations of the material body. The qualities of the material modes in the body will act, but as spirit soul the self is aloof from such activities. How does he become aloof? He does not desire to enjoy the body, nor does he desire to get out of it. Thus transcendentally situated, the devotee becomes automatically free. He need not try to become free from the influence of the modes of material nature.",
      "The next question concerns the dealings of a transcendentally situated person. The materially situated person is affected by so-called honor and dishonor offered to the body, but the transcendentally situated person is not affected by such false honor and dishonor. He performs his duty in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and does not mind whether a man honors or dishonors him. He accepts things that are favorable for his duty in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, otherwise he has no necessity of anything material, either a stone or gold. He takes everyone as his dear friend who helps him in his execution of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and he does not hate his so-called enemy. He is equally disposed and sees everything on an equal level because he knows perfectly well that he has nothing to do with material existence. Social and political issues do not affect him because he knows the situation of temporary upheavals and disturbances. He does not attempt anything for his own sake. He can attempt anything for Kṛṣṇa, but for his personal self he does not attain anything. By such behavior one becomes actually transcendentally situated."

      "This verse is a reply to Arjuna\u2019s third question: What is the means of attaining to the transcendental position? As explained before, the material world is acting under the spell of the modes of material nature. One should not be disturbed by the activities of the modes of nature; instead of putting his consciousness into such activities, he may transfer his consciousness to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a activities. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a activities are known as bhakti-yoga-always acting for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This includes not only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but His different plenary expansions such as R\u0101ma and N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. He has innumerable expansions. One who is engaged in the service of any of the forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or of His plenary expansions, is considered to be transcendentally situated. One should also note that all the forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are fully transcendental, blissful, full of knowledge and eternal. Such personalities of Godhead are omnipotent and omniscient, and they possess all transcendental qualities. So, if one engages himself in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or His plenary expansions with unfailing determination, although these modes of material nature are very difficult to overcome, he can overcome them easily. This is already explained in the Seventh Chapter. One who surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at once surmounts the influence of the modes of material nature. To be in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness or in devotional service means to acquire the equality of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Lord says that His nature is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge, and the living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme, as gold particles are part of a gold mine. Thus the living entity\u2019s spiritual position is as good as gold, as good as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in quality. The difference of individuality continues, otherwise there is no question of bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga means that the Lord is there, the devotee is there and the activity of exchange of love between the Lord and the devotee is there. Therefore the individuality of two persons is present in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the individual person, otherwise there is no meaning to bhakti-yoga. If one is not situated in the same transcendental position with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme Lord. To be a personal assistant to a king, one must acquire the qualifications. Thus the qualification is to become Brahman, or freed from all material contamination. It is said in the Vedic literature: brahmaiva san brahm\u0101pyeti. One can attain the Supreme Brahman by becoming Brahman. This means that one must qualitatively become one with Brahman. By attainment of Brahman, one does not lose his eternal Brahman identity as individual soul.\u00a0"

      "The constitution of Brahman is immortality, imperishability, eternity, and happiness. Brahman is the beginning of transcendental realization. Param\u0101tm\u0101, the Supersoul, is the middle, the second stage in transcendental realization, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate realization of the Absolute Truth. Therefore, both Param\u0101tm\u0101 and the impersonal Brahman are within the Supreme Person. It is explained in the Seventh Chapter that material nature is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord impregnates the inferior material nature with the fragments of the superior nature, and that is the spiritual touch in the material nature. When a living entity conditioned by this material nature begins the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, he elevates himself from the position of material existence and gradually rises up to the Brahman conception of the Supreme. This attainment of the Brahman conception of life is the first stage in self-realization. At this stage the Brahman realized person is transcendental to the material position, but he is not actually perfect in Brahman realization. If he wants, he can continue to stay in the Brahman position and then gradually rise up to Param\u0101tm\u0101 realization and then to the realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are many examples of this in Vedic literature. The four Kum\u0101ras were situated first in the impersonal Brahman conception of truth, but then they gradually rose to the platform of devotional service. One who cannot elevate himself beyond the impersonal conception of Brahman runs the risk of falling down. In \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that although a person may rise to the stage of impersonal Brahman, without going farther, with no information of the Supreme Person, his intelligence is not perfectly clear. Therefore, in spite of being raised to the Brahman platform, there is the chance of falling down if one is not engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. In the Vedic language it is also said: raso vai sa\u1e25; rasa\u1e41 hy ev\u0101ya\u1e41 labdhv\u0101nand\u012b bhavati. \u201cWhen one understands the Personality of God, the reservoir of pleasure, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he actually becomes transcendentally blissful.\u201d The Supreme Lord is full in six opulences, and when a devotee approaches Him, there is an exchange of these six opulences. The servant of the king enjoys on an almost equal level with the king. And so, eternal happiness, imperishable happiness, eternal life accompany devotional service. Therefore, realization of Brahman, or eternity, or imperishability is included in devotional service. This is already possessed by a person who is engaged in devotional service.\u00a0",
      "The living entity, although Brahman by nature, has the desire to lord it over the material world, and due to this he falls down. In his constitutional position, a living entity is above the three modes of material nature, but association with material nature entangles him in the different modes of material nature, goodness, passion and ignorance. Due to the association of these three modes, his desire to dominate the material world is there. By engagement in devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he is immediately situated in the transcendental position, and his unlawful desire to control material nature is removed. Therefore the process of devotional service beginning with hearing, chanting, remembering-the prescribed nine methods for realizing devotional service-should be practiced in the association of devotees. Gradually, by such association, by the influence of the spiritual master, one\u2019s material desire to dominate is removed, and one becomes firmly situated in the Lord\u2019s transcendental loving service. This method is prescribed from the twenty-second to the last verse of this chapter. Devotional service to the Lord is very simple: one should always engage in the service of the Lord, should eat the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Deity, smell the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, see the places where the Lord had His transcendental pastimes, read of the different activities of the Lord, His reciprocation of love with His devotees, chant always the transcendental vibration Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, and observe the fasting days commemorating the appearances and disappearances of the Lord and His devotees. By following such a process one becomes completely detached from all material activities. One who can thus situate himself in the brahmajyoti is equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in quality.\u00a0",
      "Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fourteenth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of the Three Modes of Material Nature.\u00a0"

Therefore one who is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, who is engaged in devotional service, already knows the Vedas.\u00a0",
      "The entanglement of this material world is compared here to a banyan tree. For one who is engaged in fruitive activities, there is no end to the banyan tree. He wanders from one branch to another, to another, to another. The tree of this material world has no end, and for one who is attached to this tree, there is no possibility of liberation. The Vedic hymns, meant for elevating oneself, are called the leaves of this tree. This tree\u2019s roots grow upward because they begin from where Brahm\u0101 is located, the topmost planet of this universe. If one can understand this indestructible tree of illusion, then one can get out of it.\u00a0",
      "This process of extrication should be understood. In the previous chapters it has been explained that there are many processes by which to get out of the material entanglement. And, up to the Thirteenth Chapter, we have seen that devotional service to the Supreme Lord is the best way. Now, the basic principle of devotional service is detachment from material activities and attachment to the transcendental service of the Lord. The process of breaking attachment to the material world is discussed in the beginning of this chapter. The root of this material existence grows upward. This means that it begins from the total material substance, from the topmost planet of the universe. From there, the whole universe is expanded, with so many branches, representing the various planetary systems. The fruits represent the results of the living entities\u2019 activities, namely, religion, economic development, sense gratification and liberation.\u00a0",
      "Now, there is no ready experience in this world of a tree situated with its branches down and its roots upward, but there is such a thing. That tree can be found beside a reservoir of water. We can see that the trees on the bank reflect upon the water with their branches down and roots up. In other words, the tree of this material world is only a reflection of the real tree of the spiritual world. This reflection of the spiritual world is situated on desire, just as the tree\u2019s reflection is situated on water. Desire is the cause of things\u2019 being situated in this reflected material light. One who wants to get out of this material existence must know this tree thoroughly through analytical study. Then he can cut off his relationship with it.\u00a0",
      "This tree, being the reflection of the real tree, is an exact replica. Everything is there in the spiritual world. The impersonalists take Brahm\u0101 to be the root of this material tree, and from the root, according to s\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy, come prak\u1e5bti, puru\u1e63a, then the three gu\u1e47as, then the five gross elements (pa\u00f1ca-mah\u0101bh\u016bta), then the ten senses (da\u015bendriya), mind, etc. In this way they divide up the whole material world. If Brahm\u0101 is the center of all manifestations, then this material world is a manifestation of the center by 180 degrees, and the other 180 degrees constitute the spiritual world. The material world is the perverted reflection, so the spiritual world must have the same variegatedness, but in reality. The prak\u1e5bti is the external energy of the Supreme Lord, and the puru\u1e63a is the Supreme Lord Himself, and that is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Since this manifestation is material, it is temporary. A reflection is temporary, for it is sometimes seen and sometimes not seen. But the origin from whence the reflection is reflected is eternal. The material reflection of the real tree has to be cut off. When it is said that a person knows the Vedas, it is assumed that he knows how to cut off attachment to this material world. If one knows that process, he actually knows the Vedas. One who is attracted by the ritualistic formulas of the Vedas is attracted by the beautiful green leaves of the tree. He does not exactly know the purpose of the Vedas. The purpose of the Vedas, as disclosed by the Personality of Godhead Himself, is to cut down this reflected tree and attain the real tree of the spiritual world.\u00a0"

      "The surrendering process is described here very nicely. The first qualification is that one should not be deluded by pride. Because the conditioned soul is puffed up, thinking himself the lord of material nature, it is very difficult for him to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should know by the cultivation of real knowledge that he is not lord of material nature; the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Lord. When one is free from delusion caused by pride, he can begin the process of surrender. For one who is always expecting some honor in this material world, it is not possible to surrender to the Supreme Person. Pride is due to illusion, for although one comes here, stays for a brief time and then goes away, he has the foolish notion that he is the lord of the world. He thus makes all things complicated, and he is always in trouble. The whole world moves under this impression. People are considering that the land, this earth, belongs to human society, and they have divided the land under the false impression that they are the proprietors. One has to get out of this false notion that human society is the proprietor of this world. When one is freed from such a false notion, he becomes free from all the false associations caused by familial, social, and national affections. These fake associations bind one to this material world. After this stage, one has to develop spiritual knowledge. One has to cultivate knowledge of what is actually his own and what is actually not his own. And, when one has an understanding of things as they are, he becomes free from all dual conceptions such as happiness and distress, pleasure and pain. He becomes full in knowledge; then it is possible for him to surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u00a0"

In the spiritual sky there is no need of sunshine, moonshine, fire or electricity, because all the planets are self-luminous. We have only one planet in this universe, the sun, which is self-luminous, but all the planets in the spiritual sky are self-luminous. The shining effulgence of all those planets (called Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas) constitutes the shining sky known as the brahmajyoti. Actually, the effulgence is emanating from the planet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Part of that shining effulgence is covered by the mahat-tattva, the material world. Other than this, the major portion of that shining sky is full of spiritual planets, which are called Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas, chief of which is Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.\u00a0",
      "As long as a living entity is in this dark material world, he is in conditional life, but as soon as he reaches the spiritual sky, by cutting through the false, perverted tree of this material world, he becomes liberated.

In his conditional life, the living entity considers himself to be the lord of this material world, but in his liberated state he enters into the spiritual kingdom and becomes the associate of the Supreme Lord. There he enjoys eternal bliss, eternal life, and full knowledge.\u00a0",
      "One should be captivated by this information. He should desire to transfer himself to that eternal world and extricate himself from this false reflection of reality. For one who is too much attached to this material world, it is very difficult to cut that attachment, but if he takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there is a chance of gradually becoming detached. One has to associate himself with devotees, those who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One should search out a society dedicated to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and learn how to discharge devotional service. In this way he can cut off his attachment to the material world. One cannot become detached from the attraction of the material world simply by dressing himself in saffron cloth. He must become attached to the devotional service of the Lord. Therefore one should take it very seriously that devotional service as described in the Twelfth Chapter is the only way to get out of this false representation of the real tree. In Chapter Fourteen the contamination of all kinds of processes by material nature is described. Only devotional service is described as purely transcendental.\u00a0",
      "The words parama\u1e41 mama are very important here. Actually every nook and corner is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the spiritual world is paramam, full of six opulences. In the Upani\u1e63ads it is also confirmed that in the spiritual world there is no need of sunshine or moonshine, for the whole spiritual sky is illuminated by the internal potency of the Supreme Lord. That supreme abode can be achieved only by surrender and by no other means.\u00a0"

  "purport": [
      "In this verse the identity of the living being is clearly given. The living entity is the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord-eternally. It is not that he assumes individuality in his conditional life and in his liberated state becomes one with the Supreme Lord. He is eternally fragmented. It is clearly said, san\u0101tana\u1e25. According to the Vedic version, the Supreme Lord manifests and expands Himself in innumerable expansions, of which the primary expansions are called Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva, and the secondary expansions are called the living entities. In other words, the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva is the personal expansion, and the living entities are separated expansions. By His personal expansion, He is manifested in various forms like Lord R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva, Vi\u1e63\u1e47um\u016brti and all the predominating Deities in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. The separated expansions, the living entities, are eternally servitors. The personal expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the individual identities of the Godhead, are always present. Similarly, the separated expansions of living entities have their identities. As fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the living entities have also fragmental qualities, of which independence is one. Every living entity has an individual soul, his personal individuality and a minute form of independence. By misuse of that independence, one becomes a conditioned soul, and by proper use of independence he is always liberated. In either case, he is qualititatively eternal, as the Supreme Lord is. In his liberated state he is freed from this material condition, and he is under the engagement of transcendental service unto the Lord; in his conditioned life he is dominated by the material modes of nature, and he forgets the transcendental loving service of the Lord. As a result, he has to struggle very hard to maintain his existence in the material world.\u00a0",
      "The living entities, not only the human beings and the cats and dogs, but even the greater controllers of the material world-Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva, and even Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-are all parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. They are all eternal, not temporary manifestations. The word kar\u1e63ati (struggling or grappling hard) is very significant. The conditioned soul is bound up, as though shackled by iron chains. He is bound up by the false ego, and the mind is the chief agent which is driving him in this material existence. When the mind is in the mode of goodness, his activities are good; when the mind is in the mode of passion, his activities are troublesome; and when the mind is in the mode of ignorance, he travels in the lower species of life. It is clear, however, in this verse, that the conditioned soul is covered by the material body, with the mind and the senses, and when he is liberated this material covering perishes, but his spiritual body manifests in its individual capacity. The following information is there in the M\u0101dhyandi-n\u0101yana-\u015bruti: sa v\u0101 e\u1e63a brahma-ni\u1e63\u1e6dha ida\u1e41 sar\u012bra\u1e41 marttyam atis\u1e5bjya brahm\u0101bhisampadya brahma\u1e47\u0101 pa\u015byati brahma\u1e47\u0101 \u015b\u1e5bnoti brahma\u1e47aiveda\u1e41 sarvam anubhavati. It is stated here that when a living entity gives up this material embodiment and enters into the spiritual world, he revives his spiritual body, and in his spiritual body he can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. He can hear and speak to Him face to face, and he can understand the Supreme Personality as He is. In sm\u1e5bti also it is understood that in the spiritual planets everyone lives in bodies featured like the Supreme Personality of Godhead\u2019s. As far as bodily construction is concerned, there is no difference between the part and parcel living entities and the expansions of Vi\u1e63\u1e47um\u016brti. In other words, at liberation the living entity gets a spiritual body by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u00a0",
      "The word mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba\u1e25 (fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord) is also very significant. The fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is not like some material broken part. We have already understood in the Second Chapter that the spirit cannot be cut into pieces. This fragment is not materially conceived. It is not like matter which can be cut into pieces and joined together again. That conception is not applicable here because the Sanskrit word san\u0101tana (eternal) is used. The fragmental portion is eternal. It is also stated in the beginning of the Second Chapter that (dehino \u2018smin yath\u0101) in each and every individual body, the fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is present. That fragmental portion, when liberated from the bodily entanglement, revives its original spiritual body in the spiritual sky in a spiritual planet and enjoys association with the Supreme Lord. It is, however, understood here that the living entity, being the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is qualitatively one, just as the parts and parcels of gold are also gold.\u00a0"

      "The word j\u00f1\u0101na-cak\u1e63u\u1e63a\u1e25 is very significant. Without knowledge, one cannot understand how a living entity leaves his present body, nor what form of body he is going to take in the next life, nor even why he is living in a particular type of body. This requires a great amount of knowledge understood from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and similar literatures heard from a bona fide spiritual master. One who is trained to perceive all these things is fortunate. Every living entity is quitting his body under certain circumstances; he is living under certain circumstances and enjoying under certain circumstances under the spell of material nature. As a result, he is suffering different kinds of happiness and distress, under the illusion of sense enjoyment. Persons who are everlastingly fooled by lust and desire lose all power of understanding their change of body and their stay in a particular body. They cannot comprehend it. Those who have developed spiritual knowledge, however, can see that the spirit is different from the body and is changing its body and enjoying in different ways. A person in such knowledge can understand how the conditioned living entity is suffering in this material existence. Therefore those who are highly developed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness try their best to give this knowledge to the people in general, for their conditional life is very much troublesome. They should come out of it and be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and liberate themselves to transfer to the spiritual world.\u00a0"

      "The unintelligent cannot understand how things are taking place. The beginning of knowledge can be established by understanding what the Lord explains here. Everyone sees the sun, moon, fire and electricity. One should simply try to understand that the splendor of the sun, the splendor of the moon, and the splendor of electricity or fire are coming from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In such a conception of life, the beginning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, lies a great deal of advancement for the conditioned soul in this material world. The living entities are essentially the parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, and He is giving herewith the hint how they can come back to Godhead, back to home. From this verse we can understand that the sun is illuminating the whole solar system. There are different universes and solar systems, and there are different suns, moons and planets also. Sunlight is due to the spiritual effulgence in the spiritual sky of the Supreme Lord. With the rise of the sun, the activities of human beings are set up. They set fire to prepare their foodstuff; they set fire to start the factories, etc. So many things are done with the help of fire. Therefore sunrise, fire and moonlight are so pleasing to the living entities. Without their help no living entity can live. So if one can understand that the light and splendor of the sun, moon and fire are emanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then one\u2019s K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness will begin. By the moonshine, all the vegetables are nourished. The moonshine is so pleasing that people can easily understand that they are living by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Without His mercy there cannot be sun, without His mercy there cannot be moon, and without His mercy there cannot be fire, and without the help of sun, moon and fire, no one can live. These are some thoughts to provoke K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in the conditioned soul.\u00a0"

      "It is understood that all the planets are floating in the air only by the energy of the Lord. The Lord enters into every atom, every planet, and every living being. That is discussed in the Brahm\u0101-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. It is said there that one plenary portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Param\u0101tm\u0101, enters into the planets, the universe, the living entity, and even into the atom. So due to His entrance, everything is appropriately manifested. When the spirit soul is there, a living man can float on the water, but when the living spark is out of the body and the body is dead, it sinks. Of course when it is decomposed it floats just like straw and other things, but as soon as the man is dead, he at once sinks in the water. Similarly, all these planets are floating in space, and this is due to the entrance of the supreme energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His energy is sustaining each planet, just like a handful of dust. If someone holds a handful of dust, there is no possibility of the dust falling, but if one throws it in the air, it will fall down. Similarly, these planets, which are floating in air, are actually held in the fist of the universal form of the Supreme Lord. By His strength and energy, all moving and unmoving things stay in their place. It is said that because of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the sun is shining and the planets are steadily moving. Were it not for Him, all the planets would scatter, like dust in air, and perish. Similarly, it is due to the Supreme Personality of Godhead that the moon nourishes all vegetables. Due to the moon\u2019s influence, the vegetables become delicious. Without the moonshine, the vegetables can neither grow nor taste succulent. Human society is working, living comfortably and enjoying food due to the supply from the Supreme Lord. Otherwise, mankind could not survive. The word ras\u0101tmaka\u1e25 is very significant. Everything becomes palatable by the agency of the Supreme Lord through the influence of the moon.\u00a0"

The commentation on the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra by Vy\u0101sadeva in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam gives the real understanding of Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra. The Supreme Lord is so full that for the deliverance of the conditioned soul He is the supplier and digester of foodstuff, the witness of his activity, the giver of knowledge in the form of Vedas and as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the teacher of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. He is worshipable by the conditioned soul. Thus God is all-good; God is all-merciful.\u00a0",
      "Anta\u1e25pravi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25 \u015b\u0101st\u0101 jan\u0101n\u0101m. The living entity forgets as soon as he quits his present body, but he begins his work again, initiated by the Supreme Lord. Although he forgets, the Lord gives him the intelligence to renew his work where he ended his last life. So not only does a living entity enjoy or suffer in this world according to the dictation from the Supreme Lord situated locally in the heart, but he receives the opportunity to understand Vedas from Him. If one is serious to understand the Vedic knowledge, then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives the required intelligence. Why does He present the Vedic knowledge for understanding? Because a living entity individually needs to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Vedic literature confirms this: yo \u2018sau sarvair vedair g\u012byate. In all Vedic literature, beginning from the four Vedas, Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra and the Upani\u1e63ads and Pur\u0101\u1e47as, the glories of the Supreme Lord are celebrated. By performing Vedic rituals, discussing the Vedic philosophy and worshiping the Lord in devotional service, He is attained. Therefore the purpose of the Vedas is to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Vedas give us direction to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the process of understanding. The ultimate goal is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra confirms this in the following words: tat tu samanvay\u0101t. One can attain perfection by understanding Vedic literature, and one can understand his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead by performing the different processes. Thus one can approach Him and at the end attain the supreme goal, who is no other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this verse, however, the purpose of the Vedas, the understanding of the Vedas and the goal of Vedas are clearly defined.\u00a0"

      "As already explained, the Lord in His incarnation as Vy\u0101sadeva compiled the Ved\u0101nta-sutra. Here the Lord is giving, in summary, the contents of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra: He says that the living entities, who are innumerable, can be divided into two classes-the fallible and the infallible. The living entities are eternally separated parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When they are in contact with the material world, they are called j\u012bva-bh\u016bt\u0101\u1e25, and the Sanskrit words given here, sarv\u0101\u1e47i bh\u016bt\u0101ni mean that they are fallible. Those who are in oneness with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, are called infallible. Oneness does not mean that they have no individuality, but that there is no disunity. They are all agreeable to the purpose of the creation. Of course, in the spiritual world, there is no such thing as creation, but since the Supreme Personality of Godhead has stated in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra that He is the source of all emanations, that conception is explained.\u00a0",
      "According to the statement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, there are two classes of men. The Vedas give evidence of this, so there is no doubt about it. The living entities, who are struggling in this world with the mind and five senses, have their material bodies which are changing as long as the living entities are conditioned. One\u2019s body changes due to contact with matter; matter is changing, so the living entity appears to be changing. But in the spiritual world the body is not made of matter; therefore there is no change. In the material world the living entity undergoes six changes-birth, growth, duration, reproduction, then dwindling and vanishing. These are the changes of the material body. But in the spiritual world the body does not change; there is no old age, there is no birth, there is no death. There all exists in oneness. It is more clearly explained as sarv\u0101\u1e47i bh\u016bt\u0101ni: any living entity who has come in contact with matter, beginning from the first created being, Brahm\u0101, down to a small ant, is changing its body; therefore they are all fallible. In the spiritual world, however, they are always liberated in oneness.\u00a0"

      "In the beginning of the Fifteenth Chapter, the banyan tree of this material world was explained. The extra roots coming out of it were compared to the activities of the living entities, some auspicious, some inauspicious. In the Ninth Chapter, also, the devas, or godly, and the asuras, the ungodly, or demons, were explained. Now, according to Vedic rites, activities in the mode of goodness are considered auspicious for progress on the path of liberation, and such activities are known as deva prakṛti, transcendental by nature. Those who are situated in the transcendental nature make progress on the path of liberation. For those who are acting in the modes of passion and ignorance, on the other hand, there is no possibility of liberation. Either they will have to remain in this material world as human beings, or they will descend among the species of animals or even lower life forms. In this Sixteenth Chapter the Lord explains both the transcendental nature and its attendant qualities, as well as the demoniac nature and its qualities. He also explains the advantages and disadvantages of these qualities.",
      "The word abhijātasya in reference to one born of transcendental qualities or godly tendencies is very significant. To beget a child in a godly atmosphere is known in the Vedic scriptures as Garbhādhāna-saṁskāra. If the parents want a child in the godly qualities they should follow the ten principles of the human being. In Bhagavad-gītā we have studied also before that sex life for begetting a good child is Kṛṣṇa Himself. Sex life is not condemned provided the process is used in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Those who are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness at least should not beget children like cats and dogs but should beget them so they may become Kṛṣṇa conscious after birth. That should be the advantage of children born of a father or mother absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.",
      "The social institution known as varṇāśrama-dharma-the institution dividing society into four divisions or castes-is not meant to divide human society according to birth. Such divisions are in terms of educational qualifications. They are to keep the society in a state of peace and prosperity. The qualities mentioned herein are explained as transcendental qualities meant for making a person progress in spiritual understanding so he can get liberated from the material world. In the varṇāśrama institution the sannyāsī, or the person in the renounced order of life, is considered to be the head or the spiritual master of all the social statuses and orders. A brāhmaṇa is considered to be the spiritual master of the three other sections of a society, namely, the kṣatriyas, the vaiśyas and the śūdras, but a sannyāsī, who is on the top of the institution, is considered to be the spiritual master of the brāhmaṇas also. For a sannyāsī, the first qualification should be fearlessness. Because a sannyāsī has to be alone without any support or guarantee of support, he has simply to depend on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If he thinks, “After leaving my connections, who will protect me?” he should not accept the renounced order of life. One must be fully convinced that Kṛṣṇa or the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His localized aspect as Paramātmā is always within, that He is seeing everything and He always knows what one intends to do. One must thus have firm conviction that Kṛṣṇa as Paramātmā will take care of a soul surrendered to Him. “I shall never be alone,” one should think. “Even if I live in the darkest regions of a forest I shall be accompanied by Kṛṣṇa, and He will give me all protection.” That conviction is called abhayam, without fear. This state of mind is necessary for a person in the renounced order of life. Then he has to purify his existence. There are so many rules and regulations to be followed in the renounced order of life. Most important of all, a sannyāsī is strictly forbidden to have any intimate relationship with a woman. He is even forbidden to talk with a woman in a secluded place. Lord Caitanya was an ideal sannyāsī, and when He was at Purī His feminine devotees could not even come near to offer their respects. They were advised to bow down from a distant place. This is not a sign of hatred for women as a class, but it is a stricture imposed on the sannyāsī not to have close connections with women. One has to follow the rules and regulations of a particular status of life in order to purify his existence. For a sannyāsī, intimate relations with women and possessions of wealth for sense gratification are strictly forbidden. The ideal sannyāsī was Lord Caitanya Himself, and we can learn from His life that He was very strict in regards to women. Although He is considered to be the most liberal incarnation of Godhead, accepting the most fallen conditioned souls, He strictly followed the rules and regulations of the sannyāsa order of the life in connection with association with woman. One of His personal associates, namely Choṭa Haridāsa, was personally associated with Lord Caitanya, along with His other confidential personal associates, but somehow or other this Choṭa Haridāsa looked lustily on a young woman, and Lord Caitanya was so strict that He at once rejected him from the society of His personal associates. Lord Caitanya said, “For a sannyāsī or anyone who is aspiring to get out of the clutches of material nature and trying to elevate himself to the spiritual nature and go back to home, back to Godhead, for him, looking toward material possessions and women for sense gratification-not even enjoying them, but just looking toward them with such a propensity-is so condemned that he had better commit suicide before experiencing such illicit desires.” So these are the processes for purification.",
      "The next item is jñāna-yoga-vyavasthitiḥ: being engaged in the cultivation of knowledge. Sannyāsī life is meant for distributing knowledge to the householders and others who have forgotten their real life of spiritual advancement. A sannyāsī is supposed to beg from door to door for his livelihood, but this does not mean that he is a beggar. Humility is also one of the qualifications of a transcendentally situated person, and out of sheer humility the sannyāsī goes from door to door, not exactly for the purpose of begging, but to see the householders and awaken them to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is the duty of a sannyāsī. If he is actually advanced and so ordered by his spiritual master, he should preach Kṛṣṇa with logic and understanding, and if he is not so advanced he should not accept the renounced order of life. But even if he has accepted the renounced order of life without sufficient knowledge, he should engage himself fully in hearing from a bona fide spiritual master to cultivate knowledge. A sannyāsī or one in the renounced order of life must be situated in fearlessness, sattva-saṁśuddhiḥ (purity) and jñāna-yoga (knowledge).",
      "The next item is charity. Charity is meant for the householders. The householders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend fifty percent of their income to propagate Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world. Thus a householder should give in charity to such institutional societies that are engaged in that way. Charity should be given to the right receiver. There are different kinds of charities, as will be explained later on, charity in the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Charity in the mode of goodness is recommended by the scriptures, but charity in the modes of passion and ignorance is not recommended because it is simply a waste of money. Charity should be given only to propagate Kṛsna consciousness all over the world. That is charity in the mode of goodness.",
      "Then as far as damaḥ (self-control) is concerned, it is not only meant for other orders of religious society, but it is especially meant for the householder. Although he has a wife, a householder should not use his senses for sex life unnecessarily. There are restrictions for the householders even in sex life, which should only be engaged in for the propagation of children. If he does not require children, he should not enjoy sex life with his wife. Modern society enjoys sex life with contraceptive methods or more abominable methods to avoid the responsibility of children. This is not in the transcendental quality but is demoniac. If anyone, even if he is a householder, wants to make progress in spiritual life, he must control his sex life and should not beget a child without the purpose of serving Kṛṣṇa. If he is able to beget children who will be in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one can produce hundreds of children, but without this capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure.",
      "Sacrifice is another item to be performed by the householders because sacrifices require a large amount of money. Other orders of life, namely the brahmacarya, the vānaprastha and sannyāsa, have no money; they live by begging. So performance of different types of sacrifice is meant for the householder. They should perform agni-hotra sacrifices as enjoined in the Vedic literature, but such sacrifices at the present moment are very expensive, and it is not possible for any householder to perform them. The best sacrifice recommended in this age is called saṅkīrtana-yajña, the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. This is the best and most inexpensive sacrifice; everyone can adopt it and derive benefit. So these three items, namely charity, sense control and performance of sacrifice, are meant for the householder.",
      "Then svādhyāyaḥ, Vedic study, and tapas, austerity, and ārjavam, gentleness or simplicity, are meant for the brahmacarya or student life. Brahmacārīs should have no connection with women; they should live a life of celibacy and engage the mind in the study of Vedic literature for cultivation of spiritual knowledge. This is called svādhyāyaḥ. Tapas or austerity is especially meant for the retired life. One should not remain a householder throughout his whole life; he must always remember that there are four divisions of life, brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha and sannyāsa. So after gṛhastha, householder life, one should retire. If one lives for a hundred years, he should spend twenty-five years in student life, twenty-five in householder life, twenty-five in retired life and twenty-five in the renounced order of life. These are the regulations of the Vedic religious discipline. A man retired from household life must practice austerities of the body, mind and tongue. That is tapasyā. The entire varṇāśrama-dharma society is meant for tapasyā. Without tapasyā or austerity no human being can get liberation. The theory that there is no need of austerity in life, that one can go on speculating and everything will be nice, is neither recommended in the Vedic literature nor in Bhagavad-gītā. Such theories are manufactured by showbottle spiritualists who are trying to gather more followers. If there are restrictions, rules and regulations, people will not become attracted. Therefore those who want followers in the name of religion, just to have a show only, don’t restrict the lives of their students nor their own lives. But that method is not approved by the Vedas.",
      "As far as simplicity is concerned, not only should a particular order of life follow this principle, but every member, be he in the brahmacarya-āśrama, or gṛhastha-āśrama or vānaprastha-āśrama. One must live very simply. ",
      "Ahiṁsā means not arresting the progressive life of any living entity. One should not think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the killing of the body there is no harm in killing animals for sense gratification. People are now addicted to eating animals, in spite of having an ample supply of grains, fruits and milk. There is no necessity for animal killing. This injunction is for everyone. When there is no other alternative, one may kill an animal, but it should be offered in sacrifice. At any rate, when there is an ample food supply for humanity, persons who are desiring to make advancement in spiritual realization should not commit violence to animals. Real ahiṁsā means not checking anyone’s progressive life. The animals are also making progress in their evolutionary life by transmigrating from one category of animal life to another. If a particular animal is killed, then his progress is checked. If an animal is staying in a particular body for so many days or so many years and is untimely killed, then he has to come back again in that form of life to complete the remaining days in order to be promoted to another species of life. So their progress should not be checked simply to satisfy one’s palate. This is called ahiṁsā.",
      "Satyam. This word means that one should not distort the truth for some personal interest. In Vedic literature there are some difficult passages, but the meaning or the purpose should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master. That is the process for understanding Vedas. Śruti means that one should hear from the authority. One should not construe some interpretation for his personal interest. There are so many commentaries on Bhagavad-gītā that misinterpret the original text. The real import of the word should be presented, and that should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master.",
      "Akrodhaḥ means to check anger. Even if there is provocation one should be tolerant, for once one becomes angry his whole body becomes polluted. Anger is the product of the modes of passion and lust, so one who is transcendentally situated should check himself from anger. Apaiśunam means that one should not find fault with others or correct them unnecessarily. Of course to call a thief a thief is not faultfinding, but to call an honest person a thief is very much offensive for one who is making advancement in spiritual life. Hrīḥ means that one should be very modest and must not perform some act which is abominable. Acāpalam, determination, means that one should not be agitated or frustrated in some attempt. There may be failure in some attempt, but one should not be sorry for that; he should make progress with patience and determination. The word tejaḥ used here is meant for the kṣatriyas. The kṣatriyas should always be very strong to be able to give protection to the weak. They should not pose themselves as nonviolent. If violence is required, they must exhibit it.",
      "Śaucam means cleanliness, not only in mind and body but in one’s dealings also. It is especially meant for the mercantile people, who should not deal in the black market. Nātimānitā, not expecting honor, applies to the śūdras, the worker class, which are considered, according to Vedic injunctions, to be the lowest of the four classes. They should not be puffed up with unnecessary prestige or honor and should remain in their own status. It is the duty of the śūdras to offer respect to the higher class for the upkeep of the social order.",
      "All these sixteen qualifications mentioned are transcendental qualities. They should be cultivated according to the different statuses of the social order. The purport is that even though material conditions are miserable, if these qualities are developed by practice, by all classes of men, then gradually it is possible to rise to the highest platform of transcendental realization."

      "In every civilized human society there is some set of scriptural rules and regulations which are followed from the beginning, especially among the \u0100ryans, those who adopt the Vedic civilization and who are known as the most advanced civilized peoples. Those who do not follow the scriptural injunctions are supposed to be demons. Therefore it is stated here that the demons do not know the scriptural rules, nor do they have any inclination to follow them. Most of them do not know them, and even if some of them know, they have not the tendency to follow them. They have no faith, nor are they willing to act in terms of the Vedic injunctions. The demons are not clean, either externally or internally.\u00a0",
      "One should always be careful to keep his body clean by bathing, brushing teeth, changing clothes, etc. As far as internal cleanliness is concerned, one should always remember the holy names of God and chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. The demons neither like nor follow all these rules for external and internal cleanliness.\u00a0",
      "As for behavior, there are many rules and regulations guiding human behavior, such as the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, which is the law of the human race. Even up to today, those who are Hindu follow the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. Laws of inheritance and other legalities are derived from this book. Now, in the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, it is clearly stated that a woman should not be given freedom. That does not mean that women are to be kept as slaves, but they are like children. Children are not given freedom, but that does not mean that they are kept as slaves. The demons have now neglected such injunctions, and they think that women should be given as much freedom as men. However, this has not improved the social condition of the world. Actually, a woman should be given protection at every stage of life. She should be given protection by the father in her younger days, by the husband in her youth, and by the grownup sons in her old age. This is proper social behavior according to the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. But modern education has artificially devised a puffed up concept of womanly life, and therefore marriage is practically now an imagination in human society. Nor is the moral condition of woman very good now. The demons, therefore, do not accept any instruction which is good for society, and because they do not follow the experience of great sages and the rules and regulations laid down by the sages, the social condition of the demoniac people is very miserable.\u00a0"

They say that this cosmic manifestation arises due to chance material actions and reactions. They do not think that the world was created by God for a certain purpose. They have their own theory: that the world has come about in its own way and that there is no reason to believe that there is a God behind it. For them there is no difference between spirit and matter, and they do not accept the Supreme Spirit. Everything is matter only, and the whole cosmos is supposed to be a mass of ignorance. According to them, everything is void, and whatever manifestation exists is due to our ignorance in perception. They take it for granted that all manifestation of diversity is a display of ignorance. Just as in a dream we may create so many things, which actually have no existence, so when we are awake we shall see that everything is simply a dream. But factually, although the demons say that life is a dream, they are very expert in enjoying this dream. And so, instead of acquiring knowledge, they become more and more implicated in their dreamland. They conclude that as a child is simply the result of sexual intercourse between man and woman, this world is born without any soul. For them it is only a combination of matter that has produced the living entities, and there is no question of the existence of the soul. As many living creatures come out from perspiration and from a dead body without any cause, similarly, the whole living world has come out of the material combinations of the cosmic manifestation. Therefore material nature is the cause of this manifestation, and there is no other cause. They do not believe in the words of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: may\u0101dhyak\u1e63e\u1e47a prak\u1e5bti\u1e25 s\u016byate sa-car\u0101caram. \u201cUnder My direction the whole material world is moving.\u201d In other words, amongst the demons there is no perfect knowledge of the creation of this world; every one of them has some particular theory of his own.

According to the law of karma, a man takes his birth in a high family, or becomes rich, or very well educated, or very beautiful because of good work in the past. The demoniac thinks that all these things are accidental and due to the strength of his personal ability. He does not sense any arrangement behind all the varieties of people, beauty, and education. Anyone who comes into competition with such a demoniac man is his enemy. There are many demoniac people, and each is enemy to the others. This enmity becomes more and more deep-between persons, then between families, then between societies, and at last between nations. Therefore there is constant strife, war and enmity all over the world.\u00a0",
      "Each demoniac person thinks that he can live at the sacrifice of all others. Generally, a demoniac person thinks of himself as the Supreme God, and a demoniac preacher tells his followers: \u201cWhy are you seeking God elsewhere? You are all yourselves God! Whatever you like, you can do. Don\u2019t believe in God. Throw away God. God is dead.\u201d These are the demoniac\u2019s preachings.\u00a0",
      "Although the demoniac person sees others equally rich and influential, or even more so, he thinks that no one is richer than him and that no one is more influential than him. As far as promotion to the higher planetary system is concerned, he does not believe in performing yaj\u00f1as or sacrifices. Demons think that they will manufacture their own process of yaj\u00f1a and prepare some machine, by which they will be able to reach any higher planet. The best example of such a demoniac man was R\u0101va\u1e47a. He offered a program to the people by which he would prepare a staircase so that anyone could reach the heavenly planets without performing sacrifices, such as are prescribed in the Vedas. Similarly, in the present age such demoniac men are striving to reach the higher planetary systems by mechanical arrangement. These are examples of bewilderment. The result is that, without their knowledge, they are gliding toward hell. Here the Sanskrit word mohaj\u0101la is very significant. J\u0101la means net; like fishes caught in a net, they have no way to come out.\u00a0"

Sometimes such demons take up the role of preacher, mislead the people, and become known as religious reformers or as incarnations of God.

Common men advertise them as God and worship them, and by the foolish they are considered advanced in the principles of religion, or in the principles of spiritual knowledge.

It is clearly stated that the demoniac people, life after life, are put into the wombs of similar demons, and, not achieving the mercy of the Supreme Lord, they go down and down, so that at last they achieve bodies like those of cats, dogs and hogs. It is clearly stated that such demons have practically no chance of receiving the mercy of God at any stage of later life. In the Vedas also it is stated that such persons gradually sink to become dogs and hogs. It may be then argued in this connection that God should not be advertised as all-merciful if He is not merciful to such demons. In answer to this question, in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra we find that the Supreme Lord has no hatred for anyone. The placing of the asuras, the demons, in the lowest status of life is simply another feature of His mercy. Sometimes the asuras are killed by the Supreme Lord, but this killing is also good for them, for in Vedic literature we find that anyone who is killed by the Supreme Lord becomes liberated. There are instances in history of many asuras-R\u0101va\u1e47a, Ka\u1e41sa, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu-to whom the Lord appeared in various incarnations just to kill.

In the human form of life, a living entity is expected to be sane and to follow the regulations given for elevating his life to the highest platform, but if he does not follow them, then he degrades himself. But even if he follows the rules and regulations and moral principles and ultimately does not come to the stage of understanding the Supreme Lord, then all his knowledge becomes spoiled.

      "As stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, all the rules and regulations of the Vedas are meant for knowing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If one understands Krs\u1e47a from the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and becomes situated in Krs\u1e47a consciousness, engaging himself in devotional service, he has reached the highest perfection of knowledge offered by the Vedic literature. Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu made this process very easy: He asked people simply to chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare and to engage in the devotional service of the Lord and eat the remnants of foodstuff offered to the Deity. One who is directly engaged in all these devotional activities is to be understood as having studied all Vedic literature. He has come to the conclusion perfectly. Of course, for the ordinary persons who are not in Krs\u1e47a consciousness or who are not engaged in devotional service, what is to be done and what is not to be done must be decided by the injunctions of the Vedas. One should act accordingly, without argument. That is called following the principles of \u015b\u0101stra, or scripture. \u015a\u0101stra is without the four principal defects that are visible in the conditioned soul: imperfect senses, the propensity for cheating, certainty of committing mistakes, and certainty of being illusioned. These four principal defects in conditioned life disqualify one from putting forth rules and regulations. Therefore, the rules and regulations as described in the \u015b\u0101stra-being above these defects-are accepted without alteration by all great saints, \u0101c\u0101ryas, and great souls.\u00a0",
      "In India there are many parties of spiritual understanding, generally classified as two: the impersonalist and the personalist. Both of them, however, lead their lives according to the principles of the Vedas. Without following the principles of the scriptures, one cannot elevate himself to the perfectional stage. One who actually, therefore, understands the purport of the \u015b\u0101stras is considered fortunate.\u00a0",
      "In human society, aversion to the principles of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all falldowns. That is the greatest offense of human life. Therefore, m\u0101y\u0101, the material energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is always giving us trouble in the shape of the threefold miseries. This material energy is constituted of the three modes of material nature. One has to raise himself at least to the mode of goodness before the path to understanding the Supreme Lord can be opened. Without raising oneself to the standard of the mode of goodness, one remains in ignorance and passion, which are the cause of demoniac life. Those in the modes of passion and ignorance deride the scriptures, deride the holy man, and deride the proper understanding of the spiritual master, and they do not care for the regulations of the scriptures. In spite of hearing the glories of devotional service, they are not attracted. Thus they manufacture their own way of elevation. These are some of the defects of human society, which lead to the demoniac status of life. If, however, one is able to be guided by a proper and bona fide spiritual master, who can lead one to the path of elevation, to the higher stage, then one\u2019s life becomes successful.\u00a0",

      "Everyone has a particular type of faith, regardless of what he is. But his faith is considered good, passionate or ignorant according to the nature he has acquired. Thus, according to his particular type of faith, one associates with certain persons. Now the real fact is that every living being, as is stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, is originally the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Therefore one is originally transcendental to all the modes of material nature. But when one forgets his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and comes into contact with the material nature in conditional life, he generates his own position by association with the different varieties of material nature. The resultant artificial faith and existence are only material. Although one may be conducted by some impression, or some conception of life, still, originally, he is nirgu\u1e47a, or transcendental. Therefore one has to become cleansed of the material contamination that he has acquired in order to regain his relationship with the Supreme Lord. That is the only path back without fear: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If one is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then that path is guaranteed for his elevation to the perfectional stage. If one does not take to this path of self-realization, then he is surely to be conducted by the influence of the modes of nature.\u00a0",
      "The word sattva, or faith, is very significant in this verse. Sattva or faith always comes out of the works of goodness. One\u2019s faith may be in a demigod or some created God or some mental concoction. It is supposed to be one\u2019s strong faith in something that is productive of the works of material goodness. But in material conditional life, no works of material nature are completely purified. They are mixed. They are not in pure goodness. Pure goodness is transcendental; in purified goodness one can understand the real nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As long as one\u2019s faith is not completely in purified goodness, the faith is subject to contamination by any of the modes of material nature. The contaminated modes of material nature expand to the heart. Therefore according to the position of the heart in contact with a particular mode of material nature, one\u2019s faith is established. It should be understood, that if one\u2019s heart is in the mode of goodness, his faith is also in the mode of goodness. If his heart is in the mode of passion, his faith is also in the mode of passion. And if his heart is in the mode of darkness, illusion, his faith is also thus contaminated. Thus we find different types of faith in this world, and there are different types of religions due to different types of faith. The real principle of religious faith is situated in the mode of pure goodness, but because the heart is tainted, we find different types of religious principles. Thus according to different types of faith, there are different kinds of worship.\u00a0"

      "In this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead describes different kinds of worshipers according to their external activities. According to scriptural injunction, only the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshipable, but those who are not very conversant with, or faithful to, the scriptural injunctions worship different objects, according to their specific situations in the modes of material nature. Those who are situated in goodness generally worship the demigods. The demigods include Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva and others such as Indra, Candra and the sun-god. There are various demigods. Those in goodness worship a particular demigod for a particular purpose. Similarly, those who are in the mode of passion worship the demons. We recall that during the Second World War, a man in Calcutta worshiped Hitler because thanks to that war he had amassed a large amount of wealth by dealing in the black market. Similarly, those in the modes of passion and ignorance generally select a powerful man to be God. They think that anyone can be worshiped as God and that the same results will be obtained.\u00a0",
      "Now, it is clearly described here that those who are in the mode of passion worship and create such gods, and those who are in the mode of ignorance, in darkness, worship dead spirits. Sometimes people worship at the tomb of some dead man. Sexual service is also considered to be in the mode of darkness. Similarly, in remote villages in India there are worshipers of ghosts. We have seen that in India the lower class people sometimes go to the forest, and if they have knowledge that a ghost lives in a tree, they worship that tree and offer sacrifices. These different kinds of worship are not actually God worship. God worship is for persons who are transcendentally situated in pure goodness. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is said, sattva\u1e41 vi\u015buddham v\u0101sudeva-\u015babditam. \u201cWhen a man is situated in pure goodness, he worships V\u0101sudeva.\u201d The purport is that those who are completely purified of the material modes of nature and who are transcendentally situated can worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u00a0",
      "The impersonalists are supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness, and they worship five kinds of demigods. They worship the impersonal Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form in the material world, which is known as philosophized Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the impersonalists, because they do not ultimately believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, imagine that the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form is just another aspect of the impersonal Brahman; similarly, they imagine that Lord Brahm\u0101 is the impersonal form in the material mode of passion. Thus they sometimes describe five kinds of gods that are worshipable, but because they think that the actual truth is impersonal Brahman, they dispose of all worshipable objects at the ultimate end. In conclusion, the different qualities of the material modes of nature can be purified through association with persons who are of transcendental nature.\u00a0"

  "purport": [
      "There are persons who manufacture modes of austerity and penances which are not mentioned in the scriptural injunctions. For instance, fasting for some ulterior purpose, such as to promote a purely political end, is not mentioned in the scriptural directions. The scriptures recommend fasting for spiritual advancement, not for some political end or social purpose. Persons who take to such austerities are, according to Bhagavad-gītā, certainly demoniac. Their acts are against the scriptural injunction and are not beneficial for the people in general. Actually, they act out of pride, false ego, lust and attachment for material enjoyment. By such activities, not only are the combination of material elements of which the body is constructed disturbed, but also the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself living within the body. Such unauthorized fasting or austerities for some political end are certainly very disturbing to others. They are not mentioned in the Vedic literature. A demoniac person may think that he can force his enemy or other parties to comply with his desire by this method, but sometimes one dies by such fasting. These acts are not approved by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He says that those who engage in them are demons. Such demonstrations are insults to the Supreme Personality of Godhead because they are enacted in disobedience to the Vedic scriptural injunctions. The word acetasaḥ is significant in this connection-persons of normal mental condition must obey the scriptural injunctions. Those who are not in such a position neglect and disobey the scriptures and manufacture their own way of austerities and penances. One should always remember the ultimate end of the demoniac people, as described in the previous chapter. The Lord forces them to take birth in the womb of demoniac persons. Consequently they will live by demoniac principles life after life without knowing their relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If, however, such persons are fortunate enough to be guided by a spiritual master who can direct them to the path of Vedic wisdom, they can get out of this entanglement and ultimately achieve the supreme goal."

Such foods cause pain, distress, and disease.

  "purport": [
      "Thc purpose of food is to increase the duration of life, purify the mind and aid bodily strength. This is its only purpose. In the past, great authorities selected those foods that best aid health and increase life’s duration, such as milk products, sugar, rice, wheat, fruits and vegetables. These foods are very dear to those in the mode of goodness. Some other foods, such as baked corn and molasses, while not very palatable in themselves, can be made pleasant when mixed with milk or other foods. They are then in the mode of goodness. All these foods are pure by nature. They are quite distinct from untouchable things like meat and liquor. Fatty foods, as mentioned in the eighth verse, have no connection with animal fat obtained by slaughter. Animal fat is available in the form of milk, which is the most wonderful of all foods. Milk, butter, cheese and similar products give animal fat in a form which rules out any need for the killing of innocent creatures. It is only through brute mentality that this killing goes on. The civilized method of obtaining needed fat is by milk. Slaughter is the way of subhumans. Protein is amply available through split peas, dhall, whole wheat, etc. ",
      "Foods in the mode of passion, which are bitter, too salty, or too hot or overly mixed with red pepper, cause misery by producing mucous in the stomach, leading to disease. Foods in the mode of ignorance or darkness are essentially those that are not fresh. Any food cooked more than three hours before it is eaten (except prasādam, food offered to the Lord) is considered to be in the mode of darkness. Because they are decomposing, such foods give a bad odor, which often attracts people in this mode but repulses those in the mode of goodness. ",
      "Remnants of food may be eaten only when they are part of a meal that was first offered to the Supreme Lord or first eaten by saintly persons, especially the spiritual master. Otherwise the remnants of food are considered to be in the mode of darkness, and they increase infection or disease. Such foodstuffs, although very palatable to persons in the mode of darkness, are neither liked nor even touched by those in the mode of goodness. The best food is the remnant of what is offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-gītā the Supreme Lord says that He accepts preparations of vegetables, flour and milk when offered with devotion. Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam. Of course, devotion and love are the chief things which the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts. But it is also mentioned that the prasādam should be prepared in a particular way. Any food prepared by the injunction of the scripture offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be taken even if prepared long, long ago, because such food is transcendental. Therefore to make food antiseptic, eatable and palatable for all persons, one should offer food to the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

To purify one\u2019s nature is to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Satisfaction of the mind can be obtained only by taking the mind away from thoughts of sense enjoyment. The more we think of sense enjoyment, the more the mind becomes dissatisfied. In the present age we unnecessarily engage the mind in so many different ways for sense gratification, and so there is no possibility of the mind\u2019s becoming satisfied. The best course is to divert the mind to the Vedic literature, which is full of satisfying stories, as in the Pur\u0101\u1e47as and the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. One can take advantage of this knowledge and thus become purified. The mind should be devoid of duplicity, and one should think of the welfare of all. Silence means that one is always thinking of self-realization. The person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness observes perfect silence in this sense. Control of the mind means detaching the mind from sense enjoyment. One should be straightforward in his dealing and thereby purify his existence.

      "It has been explained that penance, sacrifice, charity and foods are divided into three categories: the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. But whether first class, second class or third class, they are all conditioned, contaminated by the material modes of nature. When they are aimed at the Supreme-om tat sat, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal— they become means for spiritual elevation. In the scriptural injunctions such an objective is indicated. These three words, om tat sat, particularly indicate the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Vedic hymns, the word om is always found.\u00a0",
      "One who acts without following the regulations of the scriptures will not attain the Absolute Truth. He will get some temporary result, but not the ultimate end of life. The conclusion is that the performance of charities, sacrifice and penance must be done in the mode of goodness. Performed in the modes of passion or ignorance, they are certainly inferior in quality. The three words om tat sat are uttered in conjunction with the holy name of the Supreme Lord, e.g., om tad vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25. Whenever a Vedic hymn or the holy name of the Supreme Lord is uttered, om is added. This is the indication of Vedic literature. These three words are taken from Vedic hymns. Om ity etad brahma\u1e47o nedi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 n\u0101ma indicates the first goal. Then tattvamasi indicates the second goal. And sad eva saumya indicates the third goal. Combined they become om tat sat. Formerly when Brahm\u0101, the first created living entity, performed sacrifices, he spoke these three names of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The same principle holds by disciplic succession. So this hymn has great significance. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 recommends, therefore, that any work done should be done for om tat sat, or for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When one performs penance, charity, and sacrifice with these three words, he is acting in Kr\u1e63na consciousness. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is a scientific execution of transcendental activities which enables one to return home, back to Godhead. There is no loss of energy in acting in such a transcendental way.\u00a0"

Certain impersonalists consider themselves monopolizers of the knowledge of Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, but actually the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra is meant for understanding devotional service, for the Lord Himself is the composer of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, and He is its knower. That is described in the Fifteenth Chapter. In every scripture, every Veda, devotional service is the objective. That is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\u00a0",
      "As in the Second Chapter a synopsis of the whole subject matter was described, similarly, in the Eighteenth Chapter also the summary of all instruction is given. The purpose of life is indicated to be renunciation and attainment of the transcendental position above the three material modes of nature. Arjuna wants to clarify the two distinct subject matters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, namely renunciation (ty\u0101ga) and the renounced order of life (sanny\u0101sa). Thus he is asking the meaning of these two words.\u00a0",
      "Two words used in this verse to address the Supreme Lord— H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba and Ke\u015binis\u016bdana— are significant. H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the master of all senses, who can always help us attain mental serenity. Arjuna requests Him to summarize everything in such a way that he can remain equiposed. Yet he has some doubts, and doubts are always compared to demons. He therefore addresses K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Ke\u015binis\u016bdana. Ke\u015b\u012b was a most formidable demon who was killed by the Lord; now Arjuna is expecting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to kill the demon of doubt.\u00a0"

      "There are three kinds of impetus for daily work: knowledge, the object of knowledge and the knower. The instruments of work, the work itself and the worker are called the constituents of work. Any work done by any human being has these elements. Before one acts, there is some impetus, which is called inspiration. Any solution arrived at before work is actualized is a subtle form of work. Then work takes the form of action. First one has to undergo the psychological processes of thinking, feeling and willing, and that is called impetus. Actually the faith to perform acts is called knowledge. The inspiration to work is the same if it comes from the scripture or from the instruction of the spiritual master. When the inspiration is there and the worker is there, then actual activity takes place by the help of the senses. The mind is the center of all senses, and the object is work itself. These are the different phases of work as described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The sum total of all activities is called accumulation of work.\u00a0"

This is confirmed in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra— — janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25. The Supreme Lord is therefore the beginning of life of every living entity. And the Supreme Lord, by His two energies, His external energy and internal energy, is all-pervading. Therefore one should worship the Supreme Lord with His energies. Generally the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava devotees worship the Supreme Lord with His internal energy. His external energy is a perverted reflection of the internal energy. The external energy is a background, but the Supreme Lord by the expansion of His plenary portion as Param\u0101tm\u0101 is situated everywhere. He is the Supersoul of all demigods, all human beings, all animals, everywhere. One should therefore know that as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord it is his duty to render service unto the Supreme. Everyone should be engaged in devotional service to the Lord in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That is recommended in this verse.\u00a0",

If one thinks always in this way, in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then, by the grace of the Lord, he becomes fully aware of everything. That is the perfection of life. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, te\u1e63\u0101m aha\u1e41 samuddhart\u0101. The Supreme Lord Himself takes charge of delivering such a devotee. That is the highest perfection of life.

  "purport": [
      "One\u2019s occupational duty is prescribed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. As already discussed in previous verses, the duties of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra are prescribed according to the particular modes of nature. One should not imitate another\u2019s duty. A man who is by nature attracted to the kind of work done by \u015b\u016bdras should not artificially claim himself to be a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, although he may be born into a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family. In this way one should work according to his own nature; no work is abominable, if performed in the service of the Supreme Lord. The occupational duty of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is certainly in the mode of goodness, but if a person is not by nature in the mode of goodness, he should not imitate the occupational duty of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. For a k\u1e63atriya, or administrator, there are so many abominable things; a k\u1e63atriya has to be violent to kill his enemies, and sometimes a k\u1e63atriya has to tell lies for the sake of diplomacy. Such violence and duplicity accompany political affairs, but a k\u1e63atriya is not supposed to give up his occupational duty and try to perform the duties of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a.\u00a0",
      "One should act to satisfy the Supreme Lord. For example, Arjuna was a k\u1e63atriya. He was hesitating to fight the other party. But if such fighting is performed for the sake of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there need be no fear of degradation. In the business field also, sometimes a merchant has to tell so many lies to make a profit. If he does not do so, there can be no profit. Sometimes a merchant says, \u201cOh, my dear customer, for you I am making no profit,\u201d but one should know that without profit the merchant cannot exist. Therefore it should be taken as a simple lie if a merchant says that he is not making a profit. But the merchant should not think that because he is engaged in an occupation in which the telling of lies is compulsory, he should give up his profession and pursue the profession of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. That is not recommended. Whether one is a k\u1e63atriya, a vai\u015bya, or a \u015b\u016bdra doesn\u2019t matter, if he serves, by his work, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even br\u0101hma\u1e47as, who perform different types of sacrifice, sometimes must kill animals because sometimes animals are sacrificed in such ceremonies. Similarly, if a k\u1e63atriya engaged in his own occupation kills an enemy, there is no sin incurred. In the Third Chapter these matters have been clearly and elaborately explained; every man should work for the purpose of yaj\u00f1a, or for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anything done for personal sense gratification is a cause of bondage. The conclusion is that everyone should be engaged according to the particular mode of nature he has acquired, and he should decide to work only to serve the supreme cause of the Supreme Lord.\u00a0"

  "purport": [
      "In conditioned life, all work is contaminated by the material modes of nature. Even if one is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, he has to perform sacrifices in which animal killing is necessary. Similarly, a k\u1e63atriya, however pious he may be, has to fight enemies. He cannot avoid it. Similarly, a merchant, however pious he may be, must sometimes hide his profit to stay in business, or he may sometimes have to do business on the black market. These things are necessary; one cannot avoid them. Similarly, even though a man is a \u015b\u016bdra serving a bad master, he has to carry out the order of the master, even though it should not be done. Despite these flaws, one should continue to carry out his prescribed duties, for they are born out of his own nature.\u00a0",
      "A very nice example is given herein. Although fire is pure, still there is smoke. Yet smoke does not make the fire impure. Even though there is smoke in the fire, fire is still considered to be the purest of all elements. If one prefers to give up the work of a k\u1e63atriya and take up the occupation of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, he is not assured that in the occupation of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a there are no unpleasant duties. One may then conclude that in the material world no one can be completely free from the contamination of material nature. This example of fire and smoke is very appropriate in this connection. When in wintertime one takes a stone from the fire, sometimes smoke disturbs the eyes and other parts of the body, but still one must make use of the fire despite disturbing conditions. Similarly, one should not give up his natural occupation because there are some disturbing elements. Rather, one should be determined to serve the Supreme Lord by his occupational duty in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That is the perfectional point. When a particular type of occupation is performed for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, all the defects in that particular occupation are purified. When the results of work are purified, when connected with devotional service, one becomes perfect in seeing the self within, and that is self-realization.\u00a0"

      "To the impersonalist, achieving the brahma-bh\u016bta stage, becoming one with the Absolute, is the last word. But for the personalist, or pure devotee, one has to go still further to become engaged in pure devotional service. This means that one who is engaged in pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord is already in a state of liberation, called brahma-bh\u016bta, oneness with the Absolute. Without being one with the Supreme, the Absolute, one cannot render service unto Him. In the absolute conception, there is no difference between the served and the servitor; yet the distinction is there, in a higher spiritual sense.\u00a0",
      "In the material concept of life, when one works for sense gratification, there is misery, but in the absolute world, when one is engaged in pure devotional service, there is no misery. The devotee in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has nothing to lament or desire. Since God is full, a living entity who is engaged in God\u2019s service, in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, becomes also full in himself. He is just like a river cleansed of all dirty water. Because a pure devotee has no thought other than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is naturally always joyful. He does not lament for any material loss or gain because he is full in service of the Lord. He has no desire for material enjoyment because he knows that every living entity is the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and therefore eternally a servant. He does not see, in the material world, someone as higher and someone as lower; higher and lower positions are ephemeral, and a devotee has nothing to do with ephemeral appearances or disappearances. For him stone and gold are of equal value. This is the brahma-bh\u016bta stage, and this stage is attained very easily by the pure devotee. In that stage of existence, the idea of becoming one with the Supreme Brahman and annihilating one\u2019s individuality becomes hellish, and the idea of attaining the heavenly kingdom becomes phantasmagoria, and the senses are like broken serpents\u2019 teeth. As there is no fear of a serpent with broken teeth, so there is no fear from the senses when they are automatically controlled. The world is miserable for the materially infected person, but for a devotee the entire world is as good as Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, or the spiritual sky. The highest personality in this material universe is no more significant than an ant for a devotee. Such a stage can be achieved by the mercy of Lord Caitanya, who preached pure devotional service in this age.\u00a0"

      "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and His plenary portions cannot be understood by mental speculation nor by the nondevotees. If anyone wants to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has to take to pure devotional service under the guidance of a pure devotee. Otherwise, the truth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead will always be hidden. It is already stated (n\u0101ha\u1e41 prak\u0101\u015ba\u1e25) that He is not revealed to everyone. Everyone cannot understand God simply by erudite scholarship or mental speculation. Only one who is actually engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and devotional service can understand what K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is. University degrees are not helpful.\u00a0",
      "One who is fully conversant with the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a science becomes eligible to enter into the spiritual kingdom, the abode of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Becoming Brahman does not mean that one loses his identity. Devotional service is there, and as long as devotional service exists, there must be God, the devotee, and the process of devotional service. Such knowledge is never vanquished, even after liberation. Liberation involves getting free from the concept of material life; in spiritual life the same distinction is there, the same individuality is there, but in pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One should not misunderstand that the word vi\u015bate, \u201centers into Me,\u201d supports the monist theory that one becomes homogeneous with the impersonal Brahman. No. Vi\u015bate means that one can enter into the abode of the Supreme Lord in his individuality to engage in His association and render service unto Him. For instance, a green bird enters a green tree not to become one with the tree but to enjoy the fruits of the tree. Impersonalists generally give the example of a river flowing into the ocean and merging. This may be a source of happiness for the impersonalist, but the personalist keeps his personal individuality like an aquatic in the ocean. We find so many living entities within the ocean, if we go deep. Surface acquaintance with the ocean is not sufficient; one must have complete knowledge of the aquatics living in the ocean depths.\u00a0",
      "Because of his pure devotional service, a devotee can understand the transcendental qualities and the opulences of the Supreme Lord in truth. As it is stated in the Eleventh Chapter, only by devotional service can one understand. The same is confirmed here; one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by devotional service and enter into His kingdom.\u00a0",
      "After attainment of the brahma-bh\u016bta stage of freedom from material conceptions, devotional service begins by one\u2019s hearing about the Lord. When one hears about the Supreme Lord, automatically the brahma-bh\u016bta stage develops, and material contamination— greediness and lust for sense enjoyment— disappears. As lust and desires disappear from the heart of a devotee, he becomes more attached to the service of the Lord, and by such attachment he becomes free from material contamination. In that state of life he can understand the Supreme Lord. This is the statement of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also. Also after liberation the process of bhakti or transcendental service continues. The Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra confirms this: \u0101pr\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101t tatr\u0101pi hi d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dam. This means that after liberation the process of devotional service continues. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, real devotional liberation is defined as the reinstatement of the living entity in his own identity, his own constitutional position. The constitutional position is already explained: every living entity is the part and parcel fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord. Therefore his constitutional position is to serve. After liberation, this service is never stopped. Actual liberation is getting free from misconceptions of life.\u00a0"

      "When one acts in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he does not act as the master of the world. Just like a servant, one should act fully under the direction of the Supreme Lord. A servant has no individual independence. He acts only on the order of the master. A servant acting on behalf of the supreme master has no affection for profit and loss. He simply discharges his duty faithfully in terms of the order of the Lord. Now, one may argue that Arjuna was acting under the personal direction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not present, how should one act? If one acts according to the direction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this book, as well as under the guidance of the representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then the result will be the same. The Sanskrit word mat-para\u1e25 is very important in this verse. It indicates that one has no goal in life save and except acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness just to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And, while working in that way, one should think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a only: \u201cI have been appointed to discharge this particular duty by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d While acting in such a way, one naturally has to think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is perfect K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One should, however, note that, after doing something whimsically, he should not offer the result to the Supreme Lord. That sort of duty is not in the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One should act according to the order of Kr\u1e63na. This is a very important point. That order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a comes through disciplic succession from the bona fide spiritual master. Therefore the spiritual master\u2019s order should be taken as the prime duty of life. If one gets a bona fide spiritual master and acts according to his direction, then his perfection of life in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is guaranteed.\u00a0"

      "A person in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is not unduly anxious to execute the duties of his existence. The foolish cannot understand this great freedom from all anxiety.

He is already under strict material laws. But, as soon as he acts in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he is liberated, free from the material perplexities. One should note very carefully that one who is not active in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is losing himself in the material whirlpool, in the ocean of birth and death. No conditioned soul actually knows what is to be done and what is not to be done, but a person who acts in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is free to act because everything is prompted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from within and confirmed by the spiritual master.\u00a0"

      "Arjuna was a military man, and born of the nature of the k\u1e63atriya. Therefore his natural duty was to fight. But, due to false ego, he was fearing that by killing his teacher, grandfather and friends, there would be sinful reactions. Actually he was considering himself master of his actions, as if he were directing the good and bad results of such work. He forgot that the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present there, instructing him to fight. That is the forgetfulness of the conditioned soul. The Supreme Personality gives directions as to what is good and what is bad, and one simply has to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness to attain the perfection of life. No one can ascertain his destiny as the Supreme Lord can; therefore the best course is to take direction from the Supreme Lord and act. No one should neglect the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or the order of the spiritual master who is the representative of God. One should act unhesitatingly to execute the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead— that will keep him safe under all circumstances.\u00a0"

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, or He Himself, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the localized Supersoul, sits in the heart directing the living being.

In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord has explained in all respects how one can elevate his living condition. The best advice imparted to Arjuna is to surrender unto the Supersoul seated within his heart. By right discrimination, one should agree to act according to the order of the Supersoul. That will help one become situated constantly in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the highest perfectional stage of human life. Arjuna is being directly ordered by the Personality of Godhead to fight. Surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is in the best interest of the living entities. It is not for the interest of the Supreme. Before surrendering, one is free to deliberate on this subject as far as the intelligence goes; that is the best way to accept the instruction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such instruction comes also through the spiritual master, the bona fide representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u00a0"

      "The Lord has described various kinds of knowledge, processes of religion, knowledge of the Supreme Brahman, knowledge of the Supersoul, knowledge of the different types of orders and statuses of social life, knowledge of the renounced order of life, knowledge of nonattachment, sense and mind control, meditation, etc. He has described in so many ways different types of religion. Now, in summarizing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord says that Arjuna should give up all the processes that have been explained to him; he should simply surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That surrender will save him from all kinds of sinful reactions, for the Lord personally promises to protect him.\u00a0",
      "In the Eighth Chapter it was said that only one who has become free from all sinful reactions can take to the worship of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus one may think that unless he is free from all sinful reactions he cannot take to the surrendering process. To such doubts it is here said that even if one is not free from all sinful reactions, simply by the process of surrendering to \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he is automatically freed. There is no need of strenuous effort to free oneself from sinful reactions. One should unhesitatingly accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the supreme savior of all living entities. With faith and love, one should surrender unto Him.\u00a0",
      "According to the devotional process, one should simply accept such religious principles that will lead ultimately to the devotional service of the Lord. One may perform a particular occupational duty according to his position in the social order, but if by executing his duty one does not come to the point of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, all his activities are in vain.\u00a0",
      "Anything that does not lead to the perfectional stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should be avoided. One should be confident that in all circumstances K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will protect him from all difficulties. There is no need of thinking how one should keep the body and soul together. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will see to that. One should always think himself helpless and should consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the only basis for his progress in life. As soon as one seriously engages himself in devotional service to the Lord in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, at once he becomes freed from all contamination of material nature. There are different processes of religion and purificatory processes by cultivation of knowledge, meditation in the mystic yoga system, etc., but one who surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not have to execute so many methods. That simple surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will save him from unnecessarily wasting time. One can thus make all progress at once and be freed from all sinful reaction.\u00a0",
      "One should be attracted by the beautiful vision of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. His name is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because He is all-attractive. One who becomes attracted by the beautiful, all-powerful, omnipotent vision of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is fortunate. There are different kinds of transcendentalists— some of them are attached to the impersonal Brahman vision, some of them are attracted by the Supersoul feature, etc., but one who is attracted to the personal feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and, above all, one who is attracted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, is the most perfect transcendentalist. In other words, devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in full consciousness, is the most confidential part of knowledge, and this is the essence of the whole Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Karma-yog\u012bs, empiric philosophers, mystics, and devotees are all called transcendentalists, but one who is a pure devotee is the best of all. The particular words used here, m\u0101 \u015buca\u1e25, \u201cDon\u2019t fear, don\u2019t hesitate, don\u2019t worry,\u201d are very significant. One may be perplexed as to how one can give up all kinds of religious forms and simply surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but such worry is useless.\u00a0"

In other words, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is for the devotees only, but it so happens that sometimes a devotee of the Lord will hold open class, and in that class all the students are not expected to be devotees. Why do such persons hold open class? It is explained here that although everyone is not a devotee, still there are many men who are not envious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They have faith in Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If such persons hear from a bona fide devotee about the Lord, the result is that they become at once free from all sinful reactions and after that attain to the planetary system where all righteous persons are situated. Therefore simply by hearing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, even a person who does not try to be a pure devotee attains the result of righteous activities. Thus a pure devotee of the Lord gives everyone a chance to become free from all sinful reactions and to become a devotee of the Lord.\u00a0",

Those who are righteous in performing devotional service but who are not pure can attain the planetary system of the polestar, or Dhruvaloka, where Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is presiding. He is a great devotee of the Lord, and he has a special planet which is called the polestar.\u00a0"

      "The constitutional position of a living entity, represented by Arjuna, is that he has to act according to the order of the Supreme Lord. He is meant for self-discipline. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu says that the actual position of the living entity is that of eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. Forgetting this principle, the living entity becomes conditioned by material nature, but in serving the Supreme Lord, he becomes the liberated servant of God. The living entity\u2019s constitutional position is to be servitor; he either has to serve the illusory m\u0101y\u0101 or the Supreme Lord. If he serves the Supreme Lord, he is in his normal condition, but if he prefers to serve the illusory external energy, then certainly he will be in bondage. In illusion the living entity is serving in this material world. He is bound by his lust and desires, yet he thinks of himself as the master of the world. This is called illusion. When a person is liberated, his illusion is over, and he voluntarily surrenders unto the Supreme to act according to His desires. The last illusion, the last snare of m\u0101y\u0101 to trap the living entity, is the proposition that he is God. The living entity thinks that he is no longer a conditioned soul, but God. He is so unintelligent that he does not think that if he were God, then how could he be in doubt? That he does not consider. So that is the last snare of illusion. Actually to become free from the illusory energy is to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and agree to act according to His order. The word moha\u1e25 is very important in this verse. Moha\u1e25 refers to that which is opposed to knowledge. Actually real knowledge is the understanding that every living being is eternally servitor of the Lord, but instead of thinking oneself in that position, the living entity thinks that he is not servant, that he is the master of this material world, for he wants to lord it over the material nature. That is his illusion. This illusion can be overcome by the mercy of the Lord or by the mercy of a pure devotee. When that illusion is over, one agrees to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u00a0",
      "K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is acting according to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s order. A conditioned soul illusioned by the external energy of matter does not know that the Supreme Lord is the master who is full of knowledge and who is the proprietor of everything. Whatever He desires He can bestow upon His devotees; He is the friend of everyone, and He is especially inclined to His devotee. He is the controller of this material nature and of all living entities. He is also the controller of inexhaustible time, and He is full of all opulences and all potencies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead can even give Himself to the devotee. One who does not know Him is under the spell of illusion; he does not become a devotee, but a servitor of m\u0101y\u0101. Arjuna, however, after hearing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, became free from all illusion. He could understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was not only his friend, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And he understood K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a factually. So to study Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a factually. When a person is in full knowledge, he naturally surrenders to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When Arjuna understood that it was K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s plan to reduce the unnecessary increase of population, he agreed to fight according to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s desire. He again took up his weapons— his arrows and bow— to fight under the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u00a0"

      "Vy\u0101sa was the spiritual master of Sa\u00f1jaya, and Sa\u00f1jaya admits that it was by his mercy that he could understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This means that one has to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a not directly but through the medium of the spiritual master. The spiritual master is the transparent medium, although it is true that the experience is direct. This is the mystery of the disciplic succession. When the spiritual master is bona fide, then one can hear Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 directly, as Arjuna heard it. There are many mystics and yog\u012bs all over the world, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the master of all yoga systems. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s instruction is explicitly stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101-surrender unto Kr\u1e63\u1e47a. One who does so is the topmost yog\u012b. This is confirmed in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter. Yogin\u0101m api sarve\u1e63\u0101m.\u00a0",
      "N\u0101rada is the direct disciple of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the spiritual master of Vy\u0101sa. Therefore Vy\u0101sa is as bona fide as Arjuna because he comes in the disciplic succession, and Sa\u00f1jaya is the direct disciple of Vy\u0101sa. Therefore by the grace of Vy\u0101sa, his senses were purified, and he could see and hear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly. One who directly hears K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can understand this confidential knowledge. If one does not come to the disciplic succession, he cannot hear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore his knowledge is always imperfect, at least as far as understanding Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is concerned.\u00a0",
      "In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, all the yoga systems, karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga and bhakti-yoga, are explained. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the master of all such mysticism. It is to be understood, however, that as Arjuna was fortunate enough to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly, similarly, by the grace of Vy\u0101sa, Sa\u00f1jaya was also able to hear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly. Actually there is no difference in hearing directly from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or hearing directly from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a via a bona fide spiritual master like Vy\u0101sa. The spiritual master is the representative of Vy\u0101sadeva also. According to the Vedic system, on the birthday of the spiritual master, the disciples conduct the ceremony called Vy\u0101sa-p\u016bj\u0101.\u00a0"

  "purport": [
      "The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 began with an inquiry of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. He was hopeful of the victory of his sons, assisted by great warriors like Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, Dro\u1e47a and Kar\u1e47a. He was hopeful that the victory would be on his side. But, after describing the scene in the battlefield, Sa\u00f1jaya told the King, \u201cYou are thinking of victory, but my opinion is that where K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna are present, there will be all good fortune.\u201d He directly confirmed that Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra could not expect victory for his side. Victory was certain for the side of Arjuna because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was there. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s acceptance of the post of charioteer for Arjuna was an exhibition of another opulence. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is full of all opulences, and renunciation is one of them. There are many instances of such renunciation, for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also the master of renunciation.\u00a0",
      "The fight was actually between Duryodhana and Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. Arjuna was fighting on behalf of his elder brother, Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. Because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna were on the side of Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira\u2019s victory was certain. The battle was to decide who would rule the world, and Sa\u00f1jaya predicted that the power would be transferred to Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. It is also predicted here that Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, after gaining victory in this battle, would flourish more and more because he was not only righteous and pious, but he was a strict moralist. He never spoke a lie during his life.\u00a0",
      "There are many less intelligent persons who take Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to be a discussion of topics between two friends in a battlefield. But such a book cannot be scripture. Some may protest that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a incited Arjuna to fight, which is immoral, but the reality of the situation is clearly stated: Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the supreme instruction in morality. The supreme instruction of morality is stated in the Ninth Chapter, in the thirty-fourth verse: manman\u0101 bhava mad-bhakta\u1e25. One must become a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and the essence of all religion is to surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as stated, Sarva-dharm\u0101n. The instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 constitute the supreme process of religion and of morality. All other processes may be purifying and may lead to this process, but the last instruction of the G\u012bt\u0101 is the last word in all morality and religion: surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the verdict of the Eighteenth Chapter.\u00a0",
      "From Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we can understand that to realize oneself by philosophical speculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the highest perfection. This is the essence of the teachings of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The path of regulative principles according to the orders of social life and according to the different courses of religion may be a confidential path of knowledge in as far as the rituals of religion are confidential, but one is still involved with meditation and cultivation of knowledge. Surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the most confidential instruction and is the essence of the Eighteenth Chapter.\u00a0",
      "Another feature of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is that the actual truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Absolute Truth is realized in three features— impersonal Brahman, localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth means perfect knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If one understands K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then all the departments of knowledge are part and parcel of that understanding. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transcendental, for He is always situated in His eternal internal potency. The living entities are manifested and are divided into two classes, eternally conditioned and eternally liberated. Such living entities are innumerable, and they are considered fundamental parts of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Material energy is manifested into twenty-four divisions. The creation is effected by eternal time, and it is created and dissolved by external energy. This manifestation of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and invisible.\u00a0",
      "In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 five principal subject matters have been discussed: the Supreme Personality of Godhead, material nature, the living entities, eternal time and all kinds of activities. All of these are dependant on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. All conceptions of the Absolute Truth, namely, impersonal Brahman, localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, or any other transcendental conception, exist within the category of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although superficially the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity, material nature and time appear to be different, nothing is different from the Supreme. But the Supreme is always different from everything. Lord Caitanya\u2019s philosophy is that of \u201cinconceivably one and different.\u201d This system of philosophy constitutes perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth.\u00a0",
      "The living entity in his original position is pure spirit. He is just like an atomic particle of the Supreme Spirit. The conditioned living entity, however, is the marginal energy of the Lord; he tends to be in contact with both the material energy and the spiritual energy. In other words, the living entity is situated between the two energies of the Lord, and because he belongs to the superior energy of the Lord, he has a particle of independence. By proper use of that independence he comes under the direct order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus he attains his normal condition in the pleasure-giving potency.\u00a0",
      "Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighteenth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of its Conclusions— the Perfection of Renunciation.\u00a0"
